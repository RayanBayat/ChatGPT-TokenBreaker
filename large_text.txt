The Puzzle of Personality
When they receive their personality test results on our website, most people’s first
question is, “What do these letters mean?” We are of course referring to those mysterious
acronyms—INTJ-A, for example, or ENFP-T. As you may have already learned from the type
descriptions or articles on the website, the five letters of these acronyms each refer to a
specific trait, with certain trait combinations forming various types and type groups. But
before we discuss those traits in depth, let’s explore their historical foundations.
Since the dawn of time, humans have drawn up schematics to describe and categorize our
personalities. From the four temperaments of the ancient civilizations to the latest
advances in psychology, we have been driven to fit the variables and complexities of
human personality into well-defined models. Although we are still some time away from
being able to do that, the current models account for our most important personality traits
and can predict our behavior with a high degree of accuracy.
Personality is just one of many factors that guide our behavior, however. Our actions are
also influenced by our environment, our experiences, and our individual goals. This profile
describes how people belonging to a specific personality type are likely to behave. We will
outline indicators and tendencies, however, not definitive guidelines or answers.
Significant differences can exist even among people who share a personality type. The
information in this profile is meant to inspire personal growth and an improved
understanding of yourself and your relationships—not to be taken as gospel.
Our approach has its roots in two different philosophies. The first is the work of Carl Gustav
Jung, the father of analytical psychology. Dating to the early 20th century, Jung’s theory of
psychological types is perhaps the most influential in its field. One of Jung’s key
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  7
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
contributions is the concept of Introversion versus Extraversion. Jung theorized that each of
us falls into one of these two categories, focusing on either the internal world (Introvert)
or the outside world (Extravert). You might think that Introversion implies shyness and
Extraversion confers great social skills, but originally, these terms were meant to explain
whether the internal world or the outside world was more energizing for a given person.
Besides Introversion and Extraversion, Jung coined several additional concepts. Among
these are the so-called Judging functions (either Thinking or Feeling) and Perceiving functions
(either Sensing or Intuition). According to Jung, each person prefers one of these cognitive
functions and relies on it more naturally in everyday situations. The direction of these
functions is influenced by a person’s Introversion or Extraversion. Someone whose
dominant function is Introverted Feeling, for example, is likely to think differently from
someone with Extraverted Feeling at the helm.
In the 1920s, Jung’s theory was adopted by Katharine Cook Briggs, who later co-authored
the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®), one of the most popular personality indicators
used today. A teacher with an avid interest in personality typing, Briggs and her daughter,
Isabel Briggs Myers, developed a convenient schematic for describing a person’s Jungian
preferences. This is the origin of the type acronyms.
The Myers-Briggs approach includes four pairs of personality traits:
 Introversion (I) or Extraversion (E)
 Intuition (N) or Sensing (S)
 Thinking (T) or Feeling (F)
 Judging (J) or Perceiving (P)
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  8

According to this model, the first letter of a person’s type reflects the attitudes of the
dominant and subsequent functions, while the last letter indicates which function is
dominant. What does that mean? For Extraverts, the dominant function is focused on the
outside world. J means that one of the Judging functions (Thinking or Feeling) is dominant,
whereas P indicates the importance of one of the Perceiving functions (Intuition or
Sensing). For Introverts, J and P show the auxiliary rather than dominant function, as the
dominant function itself is internalized.
By necessity, this is a simplified description of the Myers-Briggs theory. Readers interested
in learning more should read Gifts Differing: Understanding Personality Type by Isabel Briggs
Myers. As we define personality traits and types differently in our model, we will not go
deeper into Jungian concepts or related theories in this profile.
Due to its simplicity and ease of use, the four-letter naming model is now shared by a
number of diverse theories and approaches, including Socionics, Keirsey Temperament
Sorter®, and Linda Berens’s Interaction Styles, among many others. While the acronyms
used by these theories may be identical or very similar, however, their meanings do not
always overlap. As a result, if you meet five people who say, “I am an INFJ,” their
understanding of what that means may vary significantly.
Regardless of its structure, any type-based theory will struggle to describe or characterize
people whose scores lie near the dividing line. A different way to look at personalities is
through the lens of a trait-based rather than a type-based model. What do we mean by that?
Instead of creating an arbitrary number of categories and attempting to fit people within
them, a trait-based model simply studies the degree to which people exhibit certain traits.
You may have heard the term Ambivert, which is a perfect example in this case.
Ambiversion means that someone falls in the middle of the Introversion-Extraversion
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  9
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
scale, being neither too outgoing nor too withdrawn. Trait-based theories would simply
say that an Ambivert is moderately Extraverted or moderately Introverted and leave it at
that, without assigning a personality type.
A trait-based approach makes it easier to reliably measure correlations between
personality traits and other characteristics—for example, political attitudes. This is why
trait-based approaches dominate psychometric research, but that’s more or less the only
area where these approaches are dominant. Because they don’t offer types or
categorizations, trait-based theories don’t translate as well as type-based theories into
specific recommendations and takeaways. Assigned categories such as Extravert or
Introvert may be limiting, but they allow us to conceptualize human personality and create
theories about why we do what we do—something that a more scientifically reliable but
colorless statement, such as you are 37% Extraverted, simply cannot do.
With the 16Personalities model, we’ve combined the best of both worlds. For its simplicity
and convenience, we use the acronym format introduced by Myers-Briggs, although we
have adapted it to accommodate five rather than four traits. Unlike some other models,
we address traits as five independent scales rather than interconnected concepts. Our
data does not support the existence of cognitive functions such as Extraverted Thinking or
Introverted Sensing, so we have instead chosen to model our definitions on the
dimensions of personality called the Big Five personality traits. These changes simplify our
model and allow us to incorporate recent developments in the field. As a result, we can
achieve a high level of accuracy while retaining the ability to define and describe distinct
personality types.
At 16Personalities, we have conducted more than 800 studies to uncover trends and
correlations between personality traits and various behaviors. Many of these studies will
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  10

be referenced in this profile, and additional information can be found in the footnotes.
Our goal is to give you access to our sources without repeating ourselves or overwhelming
you with information. If you are particularly interested in a specific study or its statistical
characteristics, please feel free to contact us via the 16Personalities website and we will
do our best to provide additional information.
For the statistically inclined: all differences quoted in this profile are statistically significant,
sample sizes of all studies are very large (usually over 25,000 respondents), internal
consistency of all five test scales is very good (α ≥ 0.85), and all scales are clearly
independent.
With that aside, let’s dig deeper into the five personality aspects!
Five Personality Aspects
Mind: Introverted (I) vs. Extraverted (E)
The distinction between Introverts and Extraverts may be the oldest notion in the history
of personality theories. It has long been observed that some people are expressive and
outgoing, while others are reserved, quiet, and more comfortable alone. The first group
recharges by engaging with the external world and communicating with other people,
whereas members of the second group are energized by spending time alone and
connecting with their own inner world.
We focus on these differences in our first scale, which we call Mind. This scale—which is
based on a person’s level of expressiveness and the degree to which he or she seeks
external stimulation—determines how we see and approach the outside world, including
people, objects, and activities. This scale correlates with a number of other personality
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  11
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
traits, such as willingness to volunteer, desire to engage in thrill-seeking activities, and
romantic assertiveness, to name just a few.
On one side of this scale, we have
Introverted individuals. You might
associate Introversion with being private
or withdrawn—or even clumsy or
antisocial—but our studies show a far
more complex picture. Generally
speaking, Introverts do not seek or require
much external stimulation. As you might
expect, an Introvert requires less
communication with others than an Extravert would, but an Introvert’s preference for less
stimulation can also influence his or her hobbies, political attitudes, and even eating or
drinking habits. To give a practical example, our studies have found that Introverts are less
likely than Extraverts to enjoy coffee and energy drinks.
But what about Extraverts? Compared
with Introverts, Extraverts are more
interested in engaging with the people,
objects, and environment around them.
This preference manifests itself in many
ways: Extraverts are less sensitive than
Introverts to noise, for example, and they
are likelier to wear bright and colorful
clothes. Extraverts not only tolerate external stimuli, however; they actually need these
stimuli in order to support their own energy.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  12

Extraverts are often energetic and willing to take the lead, especially in social situations.
They enjoy pushing themselves to the limit and challenging themselves and those around
them. Unlike Introverts, who are more cautious in their approach, Extraverts are likely to
feel that they can handle life’s challenges without much forethought. Whether that turns
out to be true depends on many other circumstances, but overall, Extraverts tend to be
more proactive in experiencing—and embracing—the world around them.
Worldwide, the three most Extraverted countries are Oman (61.66%), Yemen (59.44%), and
Saudi Arabia (58.95%). 1 The most Introverted countries are Japan (59.88%), Lithuania
(55.85%), and Portugal (54.25%). In the United States, New York (50.92%), Mississippi
(50.87%), and Illinois (50.64%) top the list for Extraverts, while West Virginia (53.62%),
Alaska (53.6%), and Maine (53.41%) report the highest percentages of Introverts.
Interestingly, if the District of Columbia were included in the comparisons, it would easily
top the Extraverted list. In our study, the average Extraversion score for the capital city’s
23,310 respondents was 53.06%—significantly above New York, its closest competitor.
Architects are Introverted. This is why they enjoy being self-sufficient, prefer working with
ideas rather than people, and don’t need great numbers of friends. They may even be able
to tune out what is happening around them. Socializing depletes Architects’ internal
energy reserves quite quickly, and when that happens, they need to return to their home
base to recharge.
Again, these are just tendencies and not predestined, unchangeable traits. For instance,
Architects are perfectly capable of honing their social skills and becoming experts in
1 The scores are shown in the 1-100% format and are converted depending on which side of the scale is
being discussed—e.g. in this case, the average respondent from Japan was 59.88% Introverted, while its
counterpart from Oman was 61.66% Extraverted.

negotiation or small talk. Architects would develop these skills out of necessity, however,
and not due to particular enthusiasm or interest.
Energy: Intuitive (N) vs. Observant (S)
Energy is the second scale in our model, and in our opinion it is the most important. While
the other four scales determine how you interact with the world (Mind), make decisions
(Nature), schedule your activities (Tactics), or react to external feedback (Identity), the
Energy scale actually determines how you see the world and what kind of information you
focus on.
All personality types can be divided into those that favor the Intuitive energy style and
those that favor the Observant energy style. Intuitive individuals tend to be visionary,
interested in ideas and abstractions, and attracted to novelty. Observant individuals, on
the other hand, prefer facts, concrete and observable things, and the tried and true.
It is important to stress that this scale has nothing to do with how we absorb information:
Intuitive and Observant types use their five senses equally well. Instead, this scale shows
whether we focus on what is possible (making connections intuitively) or what is real
(observing the environment). If you are familiar with the Big Five personality traits, you
might recognize this scale as a reworking of the openness to experience concept, with a
focus on preference for (and tolerance of) novelty and ambiguity.
Individuals with the Intuitive trait rely on their imaginations and think in terms of ideas and
possibilities. They dream, fantasize, and question why things happen the way they do,
always feeling slightly detached from the actual, concrete world. Although they observe
other people and events, their minds remain directed both inwards and somewhere
beyond—always questioning, wondering, and making connections. When all is said and
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  14
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
done, Intuitive types believe in novelty, in the open mind, and in never-ending
improvement.
In one 16Personalities study, we asked
people whether they wish they had been
born in the Age of Discovery (roughly
speaking, the 15th through the 18th
centuries). Our results showed that
Intuitive types were much more willing to
give up the convenience, comfort, and
predictability of modern life in exchange
for the excitement of exploration, distant
civilizations, and the undiscovered mysteries of the New World.2
In contrast, individuals with the Observant
trait focus on the actual world and things
happening around them. Preferring to
see, touch, feel, and experience, they are
happy to leave theories and possibilities
to others. They keep their feet on the
ground and focus on the present, instead
of wondering why or when something
might happen. Consequently, people with
this trait tend to be better at dealing with facts, tools, and concrete objects as opposed to
brainstorming, theorizing about future events, or handling abstract theories. Observant
2 55.70% of Intuitive types agreed with the statement “You sometimes wish to have been born in the Age of
Discovery.” as opposed to 31.45% of Observant ones [respondents: 31825].
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  15
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
types are also significantly better at focusing on just one thing at a time instead of juggling
multiple activities.
The Energy scale influences communication style as well. Intuitive individuals talk about
ideas and have no difficulties with allusions or reading between the lines, while Observant
types focus on facts and practical matters. This is why Intuitive types may find it challenging
to understand someone with the Observant trait, and vice versa. Intuitive types may think
that Observant individuals are materialistic, unimaginative, and simplistic, and Observant
types may see their Intuitive conversation partner as impractical, naïve, and absent-
minded. These assumptions and biases can be quite damaging, and it takes a mature
person to get past them.
Geographically, the Middle East and Asia have the largest percentage of Observant
individuals, with 8 countries in the top 10 list. Saudi Arabia (71.94%), Oman (71.03%), and
Yemen (69.76%) have the top scores among Observant countries, while Nepal (48.92%),
Albania (48.51%) and Maldives (48.44%) top the Intuitive table.
In the United States, North Dakota (59.43%), Minnesota (59.23%), and Iowa (59.04%) are
the most Observant states. On the opposite side of the table, we have Nevada (43.92%),
Rhode Island (43.75%), and West Virginia (43.47%).
Architects are Intuitive individuals. This is why they are so good at seeing possibilities and
honoring different points of view. People with this personality type spend more time
engaging in various internal discussions than observing things around them. Architects are
not that concerned about what is happening; instead, they focus on what might happen or
why something has happened. Architects hone this focus throughout their lives, which
makes them bright and imaginative thinkers.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  16
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Of course, every stick has two ends, and focus on novelty and change comes at a cost. By
directing their mental resources toward possibilities and the future, Architects inevitably
lose sight of what is happening around them. They may have difficulties dealing with
practical matters or data. If they aren’t paying attention, they may even miss something
right under their nose. Because the majority of the population has the Observant trait,
Architects may have difficulty finding a partner and connecting with others.
Nature: Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)
The third scale, which we call Nature, determines how we make decisions and cope with
emotions. While we all have feelings, there are significant differences in how different
types react to them. This scale influences a number of areas of our lives, particularly our
interactions with other people.
People with the Thinking trait seek logic
and rational arguments, relying on their
head rather than their heart. They do their
best to safeguard, manage, and conceal
their emotions. “Whatever happens, you
must always keep a cool head”—this is the
motto of Thinking individuals. These types
are not cold-blooded or indifferent,
however. People with the Thinking trait are often just as emotional as those with the
Feeling trait, but they subdue or override their feelings with their rational logic.
In several of our studies, we analyzed the attitudes of different personality types toward
philanthropy and charitable causes. Thinking types are significantly less likely to engage in
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  17
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
charitable giving or to be touched by charities’ emotional appeals.3 Does this mean that
they are unwilling to help? Not necessarily. It turns out that Thinking personalities don’t
believe that giving money to charity is the best way to make a difference.4 They may look
for other ways to be of assistance—for example, investing in education for the
disadvantaged.
In contrast, people with the Feeling trait
follow their hearts and care little about
hiding their emotions. From their
perspective, we should not be afraid to
listen to our innermost feelings and share
them with the world. These individuals
tend to be compassionate, sensitive, and
highly emotional. They would rather
cooperate than compete, although they are not naïve or easily swayed. In fact, people with
the Feeling trait are likely to fight tooth and nail for their values and beliefs. For many
Feeling types, principles and ideals are much more important than, say, professional
success. 5 Although this perspective might not seem rational, Feeling types generally
adhere to their own highly individualized—and perfectly valid—logic.
3 51.62% and 41.32% of Thinking types agreed with the statements “You rarely give to charity.” and “You are
easily touched by emotional appeals for charities.” respectively, as opposed to 33.12% and 69.28% of Feeling
types (respondents: 34557 and 41891).
4 63.05% of Thinking types agreed with the statement “Giving too much help to the disadvantaged only
causes them to become dependent.” as opposed to 40.41% of Feeling types [respondents: 32264].
5 40.13% of Feeling types agreed with the statement “You could compromise some of your principles to
advance your career.” as opposed to 54.70% of Thinking types [respondents: 42119].
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  18

Worldwide, Iran (51.91%), Georgia (50.74%), and Albania (48.94%) report highest scores on
the Thinking side of the scale. On the Feeling side, we have Singapore (61.41%), Australia
(60.1%), and New Zealand (59.98%).
In the U.S., northern states tend to be slightly more Feeling, but not significantly so. One
interesting example is the contrast between Utah and Nevada: two neighboring states that
are each first on opposite sides of the scale. In Utah, the average score is 61.19% on the
Feeling side, well above Minnesota (59.61%) and Idaho (59.54%), which take second and
third place, respectively. Nevada, on the other hand, is the most Thinker-heavy state in our
study, with its 34,576 respondents getting an average score of 42.99% on the Thinking side
of the spectrum. While that still means Feeling personality types outnumber Thinking types
significantly, we rarely see such differences between neighboring regions. Other top
Thinking states include Delaware (42.71%) and New Mexico (42.7%).
Architects belong to the Thinking group. They trust and prioritize logic, relying on rational
arguments and doing what they can to prevent their true feelings and emotions from
surfacing. People with this personality type are known for their use of the “is this going to
work?” filter, regardless of the circumstances. Architects will question everything—from
teachers’ methods during their schooling to the prospects of their romantic relationships
later in life. The Intuitive and Thinking traits form the core of the Architect personality,
making for highly intelligent, open-minded, and practical individuals, capable of great
intellectual feats, especially in scientific or technological fields. However, these qualities
also push Architects away from the majority of the population, making it difficult for them
to relate to other people, especially when it comes to handling emotions.

Tactics: Judging (J) vs. Prospecting (P)
The Tactics scale determines how we approach planning and how we handle available
options. The implications reach well beyond our calendars, however. At its core, this scale
determines our attitudes toward certainty and structure in our lives.
People with the Judging trait do not like to
keep their options open. They would
rather prepare five different contingency
plans than wait for challenges to arise.
These individuals enjoy clarity and
closure, always sticking to the plan rather
than going with the flow. It’s as if Judging
types keep a mental checklist, and once a
decision is crossed off that list, it is not open to reassessment. This mentality applies as
much to grocery shopping as it does to life goals, like buying a house.
Individuals with the Judging trait tend to have a strong work ethic, putting their duties and
responsibilities above all else. Our research indicates that Judging types are also strict
when it comes to law and order.6 Of course, this doesn’t mean that Prospecting individuals
are lawbreakers, but if you see someone go out of his or her way to use a crosswalk, that
person is likely a Judging type.
6 52.83% of Judging types agreed with the statement “You never break any rules or laws.” as opposed to
31.92% of Prospecting ones [respondents: 31921].
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  20
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
In contrast, Prospecting individuals are flexible and relaxed when it comes to dealing with
both expected and unexpected challenges. They are always scanning for opportunities and
options, willing to jump at a moment’s notice.
People with this trait understand that life
is full of possibilities, and they are
reluctant to commit to something that
might prove an inferior option in the
future. They also focus more on what
makes them happy than what their
parents, employers, or teachers expect. If
a specific task is not particularly
important or interesting, a Prospecting individual will always come up with something
better to do.
Looking at the geographical data, the global Judging-Prospecting chart has interesting
similarities with the Extraverted-Introverted one. While these scales do not influence each
other from a statistical perspective, many of the countries topping the Extraverted-
Introverted charts have correspondingly high Judging-Prospecting scores. At the top of the
Judging table we have Oman (58.05%), Yemen (57.78%), and Kuwait (55.8%), while the most
Prospecting countries are Japan (55.21%), Nepal (53.74%), and Lithuania (53.62%).
The map of the United States, however, does not show significant overlaps between these
two scales. On the Judging side of the spectrum, we have South Carolina (51.05%), Alabama
(50.97%), and Tennessee (50.8%). On the other side, the most Prospecting states are Alaska
(51.2%), Vermont (50.86%), and West Virginia (50.76%).

Architects are Judging individuals. Decisive and proactive, they often find it difficult to cope
with uncertainty and unpredictability. This is what makes Architects not just visionaries,
but also implementers, both willing and able to bring their ideas to life. That being said,
people with this personality type are not overly meticulous or rule-bound. They seek
closure rather than obsess over tiny details or procedures. Architects are idea people
rather than logisticians.
Identity: Assertive (-A) vs. Turbulent (-T)
The last scale, Identity, affects all others, reflecting how confident we are in our abilities
and decisions. In a way, this scale acts as an internal sensor, reacting to the input we get
from our environments—for instance, success or failure, feedback from others, or
pressure caused by unexpected events. The Mind and Identity scales are the alpha and the
omega of our model, acting as an external shell that we wear in all of our interactions with
the outside world. Later, we will discuss the four possible combinations of these traits,
which we call “Strategies,” but in the meantime, let’s take an in-depth look at the Identity
scale.
Assertive individuals are self-assured,
even-tempered, and resistant to stress.
They refuse to worry too much, and they
don’t push themselves too hard when it
comes to achieving goals. Similarly, they
are unlikely to spend much time thinking
about past actions or choices. According
to Assertive types, what’s done is done
and there is little point in analyzing it. Not surprisingly, people with this trait are generally
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  22

satisfied with their lives, and they feel confident in their ability to handle challenging and
unexpected situations.
In contrast, Turbulent individuals are self-
conscious and sensitive to stress. They
experience a wide range of emotions and
tend to be success-driven, perfectionistic,
and eager to improve. Always feeling the
need to do more, have more, and be
more, Turbulent types may forget how
exhausting this dissatisfaction can be—
both for themselves and for the people around them.
While the Assertive variant may seem more positive on the surface, that is not necessarily
the case. Turbulent individuals are more willing than Assertive types to change jobs if they
feel stuck in their current roles, and they think deeply about the direction of their lives.
Turbulent individuals may also outperform Assertive types in certain instances, because
they may care more about the outcome. The willingness of Turbulent types to push
themselves may ultimately enable them to achieve their goals.
Worldwide, Japan is by far the most Turbulent country, with an average score of 57.48%
on the Turbulent side. Italy (53.8%) and Brunei (52.89%) come in second and third,
respectively. On the Assertive side of the spectrum, we have Uganda (57.91%), Barbados
(57.11%), and Nigeria (57.01%).
In the United States, there is a clear east-west divide, with the East Coast being significantly
more Turbulent. West Virginia (49.3%) takes the lead on the Turbulent side, followed by
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  23

Rhode Island (48.84%) and Maine (48.73%). The most Assertive states are New Mexico
(54.7%), Colorado (54.66%), and Hawaii (54.28%).
Type Groups
Now you understand the makeup of each type. But how do these types fit together?
Our system has two layers. The first (inner) layer defines our Roles, while the second
(outer) layer gives us our Strategies.
Roles
The Role layer determines our goals, interests,
and preferred activities. Each of the four Roles
contains a set of personality types that are very
similar to one another. These groupings will also
highlight the importance of the Energy trait: each
personality type shares either the Observant or
the Intuitive trait with all other members of its
group, along with one other key trait.
Analysts (Intuitive and Thinking types,
both Assertive and Turbulent variants)
Types: Architect (INTJ), Logician (INTP), Commander (ENTJ), Debater (ENTP)
Analysts embrace rationality and impartiality, excelling in intellectual debate as well as
scientific or technological fields. They are fiercely independent, open-minded, strong-
willed, and imaginative, embracing a utilitarian perspective and focusing on what works
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  24
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
rather than what satisfies everybody. These traits make Analysts excellent strategic
thinkers but can cause difficulties in social or romantic contexts.
Analysts can be both mysterious and somewhat intimidating, especially for people who
haven’t been exposed to many personalities from this group. The most likely group to
rebel as teenagers,7 to think they would do well in politics,8 and to believe they are more
intelligent than most people,9 Analysts may not be universally liked, but they are certainly
a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, they are also likely to be misunderstood.
Because of their uncommon set of traits and skills, Analysts often have to be social
chameleons, putting mask after mask when presenting themselves to the world. A
stunning 83.73% of Analysts say they feel like no one really understands them.10
The Analyst role group is the most unevenly distributed group worldwide, with some
countries having 8 times as many Analysts as others. Iran surprises us once again, with
32% of its 17,092 respondents belonging to an Analyst type. In contrast, Oman, a
geographic neighbor with a similar respondent count (19,526), has an Analyst contingent
of just 4%. In the United States, West Virginia (13%) and Nevada (13%) have the most
Analysts, with Utah having the lowest score of 9%.
7 61.29% of Analysts agreed with the statement “As a teenager, you were quite rebellious.” Lowest score:
Sentinels, 36.56%. [respondents: 31925].
8 50.26% of Analysts agreed with the statement “You think you would do well in politics.” Lowest score:
Sentinels, 29.44% [respondents: 24922].
9 85.48% of Analysts agreed with the statement “You believe you are more intelligent than most people.”
Lowest score: Explorers, 59.49% [respondents: 27715]
10 Survey of 18991 respondents, statement: “You feel like no one really knows the true you.” Lowest score:
Sentinels, 54.97%.

Diplomats (Intuitive and Feeling types, both Assertive and Turbulent
variants)
Types: Advocate (INFJ), Mediator (INFP), Protagonist (ENFJ), Campaigner (ENFP)
Diplomats value empathy and cooperation, and they excel at diplomacy and counseling.
Members of this group are cooperative and imaginative, often playing the role of
harmonizers in their workplaces or social circles. These traits make Diplomats warm,
empathic, and influential individuals, but can prove a liability in situations that require cold
rationality or making difficult decisions.
Our research shows that Diplomats are the most likely group to believe in karma,11 to be
fascinated by myths and legends,12 and—unfortunately—to feel overwhelmed by other
people’s problems.13 They are also the most altruistic group, by far.14 These attitudes give
Diplomats a kind, caring aura, but Diplomats also have a diverse set of weaknesses that
can place their lives and relationships under strain.
Diplomats are more evenly represented worldwide than other role groups. Maldives (35%),
Puerto Rico (32%), and Brunei (32%) have the highest percentages of Diplomats, while
Saudi Arabia (7%), Oman (8%), and Yemen (10%) report the lowest scores.
11 76.48% of Diplomats agreed with the statement “You believe in karma.” Lowest score: Explorers, 60.95%.
[respondents: 18298].
12 84.52% of Diplomats agreed with the statement “You are fascinated by myths and legends.” Lowest score:
Sentinels, 56.49%. [respondents: 18788].
13 54.25% of Diplomats agreed with the statement “You often feel overwhelmed by other people’s problems.”
Lowest score: Explorers, 39.05%. [respondents: 18412].
14 83.39% of Diplomats agreed with the statement “You consider yourself an altruistic person.” Lowest score:
Analysts, 66.41%. [respondents: 15704].

In the United States, Rhode Island (28%), West Virginia (27%), and New York (27%) top the
list. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have Iowa (24%), North Dakota (24%), and
Montana (25%).
Sentinels (Observant and Judging types, both Assertive and Turbulent
variants)
Types: Logistician (ISTJ), Defender (ISFJ), Executive (ESTJ), Consul (ESFJ)
Cooperative and practical, Sentinels embrace and create order, security, and stability
wherever they go. People in this group tend to be hard working, meticulous, and
traditional, and they excel in logistical or administrative fields, especially those based on
clear hierarchies and rules. These personality types stick to their plans and do not shy away
from difficult tasks. However, they can be inflexible and reluctant to accept different points
of view.
Worldwide, Middle Eastern countries have the highest representations of Sentinels, with
Oman (59%), Yemen (56%), and Saudi Arabia (53%) reporting the highest scores. Nepal
(27%), Maldives (29%), and Brunei (29%) have lowest percentages of Sentinels.
As for the United States, South Carolina (41%), Alabama (40%), and North Carolina (40%)
take the top spots, while Rhode Island (36%), Nevada (37%), and Alaska (37%) score lowest.
Explorers (Observant and Prospecting types, both Assertive and Turbulent
variants)
Types: Virtuoso (ISTP), Adventurer (ISFP), Entrepreneur (ESTP), Entertainer (ESFP)
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  27

Explorers are the most spontaneous group, and they share an ability to connect with their
surroundings in a way that is beyond the reach of other types. Explorers are utilitarian and
practical, shining in situations that require quick reactions or the ability to think on their
feet. They are masters of a variety of tools and techniques—whether physical tools or
techniques for persuading others. Unsurprisingly, Explorers are irreplaceable in crises, and
their skill set enables them to excel in a range of arenas, from craftsmanship to
salesmanship. However, their traits can also push them to undertake risky endeavors or
focus solely on sensual pleasures.
Geographically, Explorers would likely feel most at home in Japan (50% of the population),
South Korea (47%), and—perhaps unexpectedly—Saudi Arabia (36%). Countries with
lowest Explorer percentages are Albania (18%), Macedonia (18%), and Mauritius (19%).
In the United States, the distribution of Explorers is quite different in northern and
southern states. Alaska (27%), Oregon (26%), and Wisconsin (26%) reported highest scores,
while Louisiana, South Carolina, and Georgia all scored just 23%. A difference of just a few
percentage points might seem minimal, but it is worth pointing out that our study covered
4,645,382 respondents in the United States. With such a large sample size, a distinction of
just a few percentage points indicates real differences.
Strategies
The Strategy layer reflects our preferred ways of doing things and achieving our goals.
There are four strategies:
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  28
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Confident Individualism (Introverted and Assertive types)
Confident Individualists prefer doing things alone, choosing to rely on their own skills and
instincts rather than seeking support, advice, or feedback from others. These personality
types value self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. They know where their talents lie,
and they demonstrate high self-confidence.
According to our geographical study, Bahamas
(30%), Barbados (28%), and Jamaica (27%) have
the most Confident Individualists, while Oman
(11%), Yemen (13%) and Saudi Arabia (13%) have
the lowest representation. Interestingly, the ten
nations with the fewest Confident Individualists
are all in the Middle East.
In the United States, Alaska takes the top
position with 26%, followed by Montana (25%)
and Wyoming (25%). Mississippi, Illinois, and Connecticut are on the opposite side, with
just 20% of respondents falling into this group.
People Mastery (Extraverted and Assertive types)
People Masters excel at communicating and thrive on social contact. They are at ease in
social events or in situations where they need to rely on or direct other people. Confident
in their abilities, these types do not hesitate to express their opinions. People Masters
enjoy being socially active and value knowing what makes other people tick, but they tend
not to worry about what others think of them.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  29
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Worldwide, the People Mastery strategy is most popular in Uganda (44%), Nigeria (42%),
and the United Arab Emirates (41%), and least popular in Japan (17%), Brazil (24%), and
Brunei (25%). In the United States, southern states tend to have higher scores, with Florida
(36%), Mississippi (36%), and Hawaii (35%) at the top of the rankings. On the opposite side,
we have Maine (29%), West Virginia (29%), and Kentucky (31%).
Constant Improvement (Introverted and Turbulent types)
Constant Improvers are quiet, individualistic people. They tend to be perfectionistic and
success-driven, often spending a great deal of time and effort ensuring that their work is
the best it can be. As you might guess from the name, Constant Improvers are high
achievers who dedicate themselves to their craft. Unfortunately, they tend to worry too
much about their performance.
Geographically, Japan has by far the largest percentage of Constant Improvement types,
at 48%. Italy and Lithuania follow, with 36% each. Oman (16%), Uganda (17%), and Jordan
(18%) have the lowest numbers.
The map for the United States also shows a significant gap, with West Virginia (33%), Maine
(32%), and Rhode Island (30%) topping the rankings, and Mississippi, California and
Colorado falling at the bottom, with 25% each.
Social Engagement (Extraverted and Turbulent types)
The last strategy is adopted by sociable, energetic, and success-driven types. Restless and
perfectionistic, Social Engagers value their social status and are eager to succeed in
everything they do. Their curiosity and willingness to work hard make them high achievers,
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  30

but they can be quite sensitive to the opinions of others. Social Engagers may find
themselves vacillating between very positive and very negative emotions.
Oman (31%), Saudi Arabia (30%), and Syria (30%) have the highest percentages of Social
Engagement types, while Barbados (12%), Bahamas (13%), and Jamaica (14%) have the
lowest. In the United States, the top positions are taken by Illinois, Massachusetts, and
New Jersey with 19% each. On the other end of the spectrum, we have Alaska (14%),
Montana (15%), and New Mexico (15%).
Now that we’ve established this background, let’s proceed to discussing your personality
type and its place in the world!
So Who Is “The Architect”?
The Architect is one of 16 personality types in our model. As we discussed in the Five
Personality Aspects section, people with this type have Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking and
Judging traits, which places them in the Analyst role group. The fifth trait, Assertive or
Turbulent, determines which strategy a specific Architect falls under: Confident
Individualism for Assertive Architects or Constant Improvement for Turbulent ones.
Depending on this final trait, the type acronym for an Architect will be either INTJ-A or INTJ-
T.
The Architect is among the rarest and most interesting personality types. Our research
shows that only about 2% of the world’s population is Architects. These percentages vary
across regions, but only a handful of countries have representations higher than 3.5 or 4%.
Iran tops the chart, with an estimated 5% of the population falling into the Architect type
(1.31% Assertive and 3.8% Turbulent). In contrast, other countries in the Middle East report
significantly lower percentages, with Oman taking the last position worldwide at 0.8%.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  31
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Within the United States, the highest percentages are reported by West Virginia (2.55%),
Nevada (2.52%), and Alaska (2.48%). North Dakota (1.74%), Vermont (1.78%), and
Minnesota (1.82%) have the lowest representation of Architects.
On a separate note, Architects tend to be significantly overrepresented in the virtual world,
often accounting for 25% or more of the participants in a specific forum or a community
site (e.g., Reddit.com).
In the chart below, you can see the estimated frequency of all personality types, including
Architects (highlighted). Please keep in mind that these are only estimates based on our
research. While our test has been taken by millions of people around the world and we
have done our best to account for various online biases, it is impossible to know the exact
percentages without conducting extensive, on-the-ground studies.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  32
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Thanks to their personality traits and associated behaviors, Architects are often seen as
both highly intelligent and perplexingly enigmatic. Idealistic visionaries, unemotional
robots, brilliant strategists, socially awkward geeks, fearsome debaters— these are just a
few of the many labels that Architects attract. Other personality types may be drawn to or
discomfited by an Architect’s quirks. With strongly expressed Architect personalities, there
is usually no middle ground. The Architects themselves are either proud of their traits or
abashed by them. In the latter case, they might do their best to mimic the behavior of
other people and blend in. These attitudes soften as people grow and develop, but at a
younger age they can be stark.
Like other Analysts, Architects radiate self-confidence, relying on their deep knowledge of
a variety of subjects. Architects—who might be known to the people in their lives as
bookworms—usually begin amassing this knowledge in early childhood. People with this
personality type lean toward scientific or technological pursuits, although there are
exceptions to this tendency. As long as they have an opportunity to devise or improve
some kind of a system, Architects can apply their skills successfully in many different fields.
People with this personality type tend to believe that they are intelligent and capable, and
sometimes this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Once Architects have mastered their chosen
area of knowledge, they can quickly and honestly say whether they know the answer to a
specific question. Secure in the knowledge that they are often right, Architects see no
reason why they should not feel smart and act as if they are smart.
Architects are decisive, original, and insightful. Their willpower and self-assurance can
persuade others to accept their ideas. Architect personalities do not seek or enjoy the
spotlight, however, and they will only venture their opinion in cases where they think their
contribution will make a difference. Because they expect the people around them to form
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  33
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
their own opinions and make their own decisions, Architects are reluctant to manipulate
or control other people. Unsurprisingly, the Architect can be labeled as the most
independent of all personality types.
Architects are brutally honest, direct, and rational. They say what they think and give
solutions that they believe are right, even if that advice may not be popular or particularly
welcome. Architects are unlikely to sugarcoat their words and questions, and if they need
something, they will ask directly. Furthermore, they absolutely love biting and dark humor.
There is no joke that an Architect cannot handle.
Curious and perfectionistic, Architects take great pleasure in improving ideas and systems.
They aren’t lured by just any project or strategy, however. For an Architect, every idea must
pass the cold-blooded filter called “Is this going to work?” This filter is a coping mechanism
for Architects, who are notorious for questioning absolutely everything and everyone.
Titles and social standing hold little sway for Architects, and so they will not accept an idea
based only on its author’s status.
People with this personality type have little patience for rules that make no sense to them.
While some other types happily accept the argument that “things have always been done
this way,” Architects question and challenge existing procedures. This is one reason that
Architects may have difficulties finding satisfaction in corporate or other highly structured
and hierarchical environments—for example, the military. Although Architects may force
themselves to follow orders and satisfy expectations, the resulting discomfort and lack of
authenticity may move them to explore other possibilities.
Architect personalities have an unusual combination of both decisiveness and vivid
imagination. In practice, this means they can both design a brilliant plan and execute it.
Imagine a giant chessboard where the pieces are constantly moving and exploring new
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  34
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
tactics, directed by an unseen hand. This is what the Architect’s imagination is like. An
Architect assesses all possible situations, calculates strategic and tactical moves, and more
often than not develops a contingency plan or two as well. When Architects work to devise
something new or improve an existing system, they regard the task as a moral obligation,
merging their perfectionism and drive into a formidable force. An Architect will likely lose
respect for anyone—even higher ranks of management—who lacks the talent or
perspective to appreciate this work.
Architects are natural leaders and excellent strategists, capable of making important
decisions without consulting their peers. That said, Architects might willingly let others
assume a leadership position, usually people with Extraverted personality types. Such an
action can be deceptive, however. An Architect will retreat into the shadows, maintaining
his or her grip on key decisions, and as soon as the leader stumbles, the Architect will not
hesitate to act—perhaps even while staying in the background. The Architect personality
is the ultimate “man behind the curtain.”
Architects bristle at rules and artificial limitations. According to their perspective, nothing
should be guarded from evaluation or reevaluation. They may hold idealistic (impossible is
nothing) and cynical (everybody lies) viewpoints at the same time. They are adept at devising
unorthodox solutions, and whatever the circumstances, you can rely on them to find—and
fix—the gaps in an idea.
Generally speaking, Architects prefer to work in an area they know very well. A typical
career for an Architect would be related to science, project management, strategy, or
engineering, but Architects can be found anywhere there is a need for intelligence, a
restless mind, and insight—for example, law, investigations, and some academic fields.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
The Puzzle of Personality  35
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Architect personalities rarely seek managerial positions, and when they do, they’re usually
driven by a need for more power and freedom of action, not by a desire to manage people.
Every personality type comes with its weaknesses, and Architects are not an exception.
There is one area in particular where their brilliant minds can prove useless or even hinder
their efforts: romance. Architects find it very difficult to handle romantic relationships,
especially in the earliest stages. People with this personality type are more than capable
of loving and taking care of the people close to them, but they can be completely clueless
when it comes to attracting a partner.
The main reason for this is that Architect personalities are both private and incredibly
rational. The complex social rituals entailed by the “dating game”—flirting or small talk, for
example—don’t come naturally to Architects. Furthermore, Architects (especially women)
view typical attraction tactics, such as feigning disinterest, as stupid or irrational. Ironically,
Architects are most likely to attract a partner when they stop looking and allow their
natural self-assurance to shine. Few things, it turns out, are more attractive than the
Architect’s trademark self-confidence.

Strengths, Weaknesses, and Motivation
Architects are the ultimate analysts and strategists. They tend to surpass other personality
types when it comes to quickly and objectively processing available data and making a
logical choice. This trait can be the Architect’s greatest advantage or worst obstacle,
depending on the situation. Life itself is not always logical, so Architects must learn to
combine their intellectual prowess with other skills to succeed in life.
The biggest problem for Architects is that they can be overconfident in their analytical
abilities. After seeing their logical conclusions prove correct over and over again, Architects
can develop a sort of tunnel vision and strong sense of superiority—even on matters
unrelated to their specialty. There are many situations where the most logical choice may
not be best, but Architects may struggle to accept this notion.
No other type is more likely than Architects to believe that they have a superior mind and
to view others as inferior or irrational. By the same token, no other type is as capable of
assessing something impartially and identifying areas for improvement—whether a
project, a theory, or their own personality. If they see a good enough reason, Architects
have an amazing capacity to improve themselves, but they need to understand the nature
and origins of their strengths and weaknesses.
Strengths
 High self-confidence. Architect personalities rarely doubt themselves or stress
about their social stature. Consequently, they are not afraid to voice their own
opinions. This boldness reinforces the Architect’s self-esteem and self-confidence
even further.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Strengths, Weaknesses, and Motivation  38
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
 Quick and versatile mind. Architects excel at gaining knowledge of the diverse
topics and fields that interest them. People with this personality type take pleasure
in tackling intellectual challenges, and they are driven by their natural curiosity.
 Success mindset. Other personality types may pride themselves on being artistic,
empathic, convincing, or athletic, but an Architect’s most important strength is his
or her mind. Architects can succeed in a range of fields—even those that don’t draw
on their natural strengths—by using their intellect to analyze the status quo, deduce
best practices, and then apply these tactics to achieve their goals. Consequently,
Architect personalities usually manage to become whatever they wish—whether an
IT architect, a top salesperson, or a high-flying politician.
 Independent and decisive. People with the Architect personality type are ruthless
when it comes to assessing the usefulness of methods or ideas. If the Architect
believes that a particular idea does not make sense, only overwhelming rational
arguments will convince them otherwise. They could not care less whether that idea
is popular or supported by an authority figure. This strength makes Architects
efficient and impartial decision-makers, often from a young age. Architects also
remain rational and calm in emotionally charged situations, which makes them
resistant to conflicts.
 Hard-working and determined. When tackling projects that excite or intrigue
them, Architect personalities can be patient and dedicated. They will work single-
mindedly to achieve their goals, often ignoring everything else. That said, Architects
may appear lazy in situations that do not require them to flex their mental muscles.
For instance, they may not study particularly hard at school, knowing that in all
likelihood, they will achieve good grades regardless.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Strengths, Weaknesses, and Motivation  39
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
 Imaginative and strategic. Architects are excellent strategic thinkers, and this trait
prompts them to devise multiple contingency plans in both professional and
personal situations. They like to plan ahead and be prepared, imagining all potential
scenarios and outcomes.
 Honest and direct. People with this personality type hate playing social games.
They will be honest and objective—even when the result is an awkward or
uncomfortable social situation. Architects see most social codes or protocols as
pointless and irrational, and they prefer an inconvenient truth to a comforting lie.
 Open-minded. Architect personalities don’t mind being proven wrong, and they
enjoy being exposed to new facts and ideas. Thanks to their ability to disregard
conventions and expectations, they will happily embrace a new or competing theory
if it makes sense to them. Not surprisingly, Architects also tend to be liberal in a
social sense, and they consider many social norms outdated or unnecessarily
restrictive.
Weaknesses
 Arrogant. There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance. Less mature
Architects may overestimate the importance of their knowledge or analytical skills,
and they may openly dismiss other people as irrational or intellectually inferior.
 Perfectionists. Architect personalities loathe inefficiency and imperfection, and
they will strive to eliminate all possible flaws and plan for all contingencies. If left
unchecked, this trait can easily become a weakness, slowing down Architects’ work
and frustrating the people around them.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Strengths, Weaknesses, and Motivation  40
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
 Likely to overanalyze everything. Architects believe that everything can be
analyzed, even things that are not necessarily rational—for example, relationships.
They may seek logical explanations and solutions in every situation, refusing to trust
their emotions or intuition.
 Judgmental. Although Architects are generally open-minded, they have little
patience for things they consider illogical—e.g., emotional outbursts, reluctance to
accept data and evidence, or decisions based on feelings. An Architect will lose
respect for people who demonstrate these behaviors, judging them as immature or
irrational.
 May be insensitive. Architect personalities pride themselves on being brutally
honest and logical. They may fail, however, to take into account another person’s
emotional state, background, and individual circumstances. As a result, an
Architect’s directness and honesty may hurt others and prove a major weakness in
social situations.
 Often clueless about romantic relationships. Many Architects find themselves
out of their element when they can’t rely on logical reasoning, and this weakness is
especially visible in interpersonal relationships. Architects may overanalyze
everything, attempt to apply a scientific approach to dating, become frustrated by
the difficulty of understanding another person’s perspective, or just give up
altogether.
 Loathe highly structured environments. Architect personalities do not respect
rules or regulations that lack clear rationales. As a result, Architects chafe at
environments that are built on blind obedience, traditions, or respect for authority.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Strengths, Weaknesses, and Motivation  41
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
In these situations, Architects will challenge the status quo and clash with people
who prefer stability and safety.
Motivation
Now that we have covered these key traits, the next step is to dig deeper into what really
makes an Architect like you tick. Your motivation stems from your self-esteem, self-
respect, and self-confidence. Although these concepts are closely related, there are
important distinctions. Self-esteem is your sense of your own worth. Self-respect speaks
to how much you like yourself. Self-confidence is where you find the energy that moves
you forward. In life, much of our motivation comes from trying to satisfy these core aspects
of ourselves. Think of them as three powerful psychological engines that, when
understood and harnessed, can lead to a successful and fulfilling life.
If you allow these engines to overheat, however, they can become a source of great
difficulty. This usually happens because something in our psychological make-up needs
support. For example, if for some reason we’re not feeling self-confident, we might
overcompensate or throw ourselves into the one thing that gives us confidence.
We begin each of the following sections by describing the three engines—self-esteem, self-
respect, and self-confidence—in their ideal, healthy forms. We then explain what happens
when these engines go into overdrive. These descriptions may sound extreme, especially
for most Architects and other Analysts. You might find it helpful to think of these sections
as cautionary tales or as accounts of tendencies that shouldn’t go unchecked.
Each section concludes with rebalancing exercises that will enable you to move more
effectively through your life. These exercises are founded on the philosophy that self-

improvement is about stepping outside your comfort zone and expanding your life for the
better.
Self-Esteem
Ideal Self-Esteem: Architects base their sense of self-worth on their intellectual ability,
their resourcefulness, and their problem-solving skills. Because of their wide-ranging
knowledge, Architects can perform like a walking search engine, able to summon up
pertinent facts in an instant. Thanks to their Intuitive and Thinking traits, they can draw
logical and useful insights from assorted facts, data, and information.
Since this capability is such an integral part of their identity, it’s natural that Architects like
to come across as experts. They take pride in being knowledgeable and rational, and they
enjoy being called on to make sense of complicated situations or processes. They can be
most helpful in untangling complex problems and proposing unexpected solutions.
Unbalanced Self-Esteem: Architects are not the most socially adept people, and they can
come across as awkward, condescending, or abrasive. If their self-esteem is unbalanced,
they may believe what goes on in their heads is more important than the people around
them.
When Architects need to strengthen their sense of self-worth, their resourcefulness can
overheat and transform into arrogance. In this situation, Architects may trumpet their own
ideas and solutions, ignoring the opinions of others. Architects’ intellectual prowess may
often put them in the right, but they risk forgetting that ingredients other than logic can
contribute to the right decision.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Strengths, Weaknesses, and Motivation  43

If Architects discount the contributions of others, their social lives and career prospects
can suffer. Condescension isn’t pretty, and no one likes a know-it-all.
Rebalanced Self-Esteem: Empathy may not come naturally to Architects. (As an extreme
example, think of Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory.) To rebalance their self-
esteem, however, they can use their analytical tools in a way that is tantamount to
empathy.
Architects can view their efforts to understand other people and other personality types
as an intellectual exercise akin to visiting a foreign culture. When visiting another culture,
you might not “go native,” but you would certainly try to respect others’ way of living. You
might even become a curious observer, learning the language and absorbing the local
customs.
Architects can do something similar. When they’ve inadvertently upset or alienated
someone, they can play the mental game of “anthropologist” in order to understand that
person’s perspective and learn how to repair the rift. This exercise enables Architects to
deliberately channel their analytical skills in a socially healthy direction. Learning about
other personality types and their variants can provide Architects with useful background
for this type of work.
Self-Respect
Ideal Self-Respect: Architects respect themselves most when they maintain
independence. They like to keep their own counsel as they navigate the world, applying
their ideas and heavy-duty intellects as much as possible. For an Architect, depending on
someone else’s ideas or conclusions is deeply unsatisfying.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Strengths, Weaknesses, and Motivation  44
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
This motivator can lead Architects down the “road less traveled,” resulting in fresh or even
revolutionary perspectives. Architects’ agile minds can glimpse what others miss, which is
a powerful point of pride and source of self-respect for this personality type.
Unbalanced Self-Respect: With their love of independence, “overheated” Architects may
come to disdain even conventions and structures that are necessary for their academic or
career goals. No person is an island, however—not even an Architect. If their loathing for
conformity turns extreme, Architects can become useless to an organization, and other
people may find them generally unpleasant. An extreme belief in going it alone can
seriously hamper success.
Rebalanced Self-Respect: For Architects, the solution is nearly always to return to their
intellect and their world of ideas. When Architects encounter a convention or philosophy
that clashes with their internal logic, they should ask themselves, “What can I get from this?
How can this help me advance?” This line of thought might sound calculating, but it can
enable Architects to move forward, work smoothly with others, and have their needs met.
And who knows? By “playing the game,” Architects may expand their comfort zone to the
point where they can appreciate others’ viewpoints.
Self-Confidence
Ideal Self-Confidence: Architects move forward thanks to their willpower and their
confidence that they can tackle any challenge that comes their way. Architects develop this
confidence based on their trust in their own mind and their track record of using logic and
intellect in order to control outcomes. In its ideal expression, an Architect’s confidence
persuades and attracts others, and it enables Architects to change the status quo in
meaningful and unexpected ways.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Strengths, Weaknesses, and Motivation  45
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Unbalanced Self-Confidence: Architects may lose confidence in areas of their lives where
their logical minds and exceptional willpower don’t grant them any degree of superiority
or control. Sexual feelings, for example, are not always rational. Emotions rarely comply
with how we want to feel. Even if we adopt the healthiest lifestyle habits, sometimes we
get sick regardless. Other people may disagree with us despite our best efforts. People we
care about die.
In these circumstances, Architects can feel lost or afraid. In an attempt to regain confidence
and control, they may resist the situations they find themselves in and push themselves—
or others—too hard.
Rebalanced Self-Confidence: Many twelve-step programs invoke the Serenity Prayer by
theologian Reinhold Niebuhr: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
Distinguishing between what can and cannot be changed is a useful exercise for Architects,
and they might even consider writing out a detailed inventory of items that are or aren’t
under their control. By helping Architects recognize that not everything can be bent to their
will, this exercise may help Architects accept facets of their lives that are beyond their
control and enjoy a degree of serenity and confidence.
Out of all Analyst types, Architects are the most likely to benefit from this kind of exercise.
Depending on the environment, the self-confidence concept can have a certain Catch-22
feel to it, drawing strength from past successes while also being a catalyst for future ones.
Our research shows that this is the least likely Analyst type to embrace the idea that it is
better to regret something they did than something they did not do, while it is precisely
this kind of attitude that can help them build up and rebalance their self-confidence. If
Architects can overcome their unwillingness to acknowledge that some factors are simply
“The Architect” (INTJ)

beyond their control and then dare to move forward anyway, they may find that they are
more resourceful than they thought.

Knowing your strengths and weaknesses is a start, but let’s look at how you can leverage
or address them.
How to Make Good Use of Architect Traits
The Architect mind is at its best when analyzing complex data or devising unexpected
strategies to achieve a specific goal. Architects can quickly and systematically determine a
fact or idea’s significance and then fit that piece of the puzzle into the larger picture. This
skill makes them excellent analysts and strategists, albeit with one caveat. In order to
achieve their full potential, Architects must balance their Intuitive and Thinking traits.
When it comes to generating new ideas, the Intuitive trait should be given priority, but the
Thinking trait should eventually step in and force the Architect to pick one idea and set
aside the others. In other words, the Thinking trait should be used to make decisions, as
long as it doesn’t stifle the Intuitive trait’s ability to generate fresh ideas.
Architects can be determined and passionate when they truly care about something. They
should make a conscious effort, however, to focus on one project instead of jumping from
one topic to another. As Thomas Edison (who is believed to have been an Architect) once
said, “Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.” No matter how
intelligent, Architects must stay on track—even through relatively dull phases of their
projects—in order to see their work through to completion.
Architects often understand and utilize principles or ideas that others might consider too
intellectually challenging. In order to grow, however, Architects should recognize that they
have much to learn and develop their willingness to explore unfamiliar territory. Architects
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Personal Growth  48
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
can be reluctant to do things that might endanger their innate self-confidence—trying to
learn something that is completely new to them, for example. Growth-oriented Architects
should recognize this and allow themselves to experience the full extent of the learning
process, including frustration and possibly even failure.
Architects tend to be stable individuals, capable of developing numerous contingency
plans for anything that could potentially go wrong in their lives. This makes people with
this personality type surprisingly resilient. In addition to benefitting their professional life
and financial standing, Architects’ stability and inherent self-confidence make them very
attractive partners. This is especially true after the tumult of early adulthood (age 18 – 25),
so young Architects shouldn’t worry too much if they have difficulty finding a suitable
partner. People’s preferences change as they grow and mature, and Architects’ traits tend
to become more attractive to potential partners over time.
Architects are also known for their wit and sense of humor. Thanks to their well-developed
intuition and encyclopedic knowledge, Architects have no difficulty making unexpected
mental connections and coming up with interesting retorts. Masters of sarcasm, Architects
often take pleasure in seeing other people try to read between the lines and decipher their
jokes. This sense of humor can be the Architect’s savior in social situations where they are
expected to relax and come out of their shell. A little self-deprecating humor will go a long
way in such cases.
Architects have better critical thinking skills than most people, and their capacity to analyze
their own motives, decisions, and mistakes is a great strength. This self-awareness is
helpful to Architects when it comes to setting goals, maintaining a balanced self-image,
and growing as a person. Architects should remember, however, that overthinking things
will only hold them back and that not every situation lends itself to objective analysis.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Personal Growth  49
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Architects like to explore everything—whether the secrets of nature, the wonders of
technology, or the depths of their own mind—and more often than not, they find a way to
improve things they do not like. Unsurprisingly, most Architects are aware of their
weaknesses and know how to address them, if necessary. Many Architects even say that
there is no such thing as a weakness, and that it is all a matter of perspective. And they are
right: some people are better at certain things than others, but that does not mean that
everyone should strive to be good at everything.
As an Architect, your interests, preferences, and personality will be different than those of
most other people, but it’s important to be happy with yourself. Architects (especially
Architect women) are rare, so it’s understandable that many common values—such as
material success or social prowess—won’t resonate with you. Especially in the Western
world, society is dominated by Observant types (Sentinels in particular), and their
perspective influences which traits are widely considered to be strengths and which are
seen as weaknesses. This doesn’t mean that you should change who you are in order to
be successful. Recognize and address your weak points, but don’t alter your personality to
meet others’ expectations or develop traits that go against who you are.
Consider what Steve Jobs said in 2005:
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma —
which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions
drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart
and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is
secondary.

What Causes the Most Problems for Architects?
Architects are unfazed by conflict and criticism, but only if they consider their opposition
to be rational. Architects will offhandedly dismiss—or, depending on their mood, rip
apart—any argument they see as irrational or as coming from an untested source. This
tendency may prevent Architects from recognizing important counterarguments and new
sources of information.
Despite their analytical abilities, Architects tend to be less adept than other types when it
comes to emotional matters and aesthetic considerations, such as fashion, style, and
design. When these issues are a source of conflict with the people in their lives, Architects
can feel vulnerable or unmoored. Rather than retreating behind their rationality, Architects
should consciously try to learn from these experiences and expand their comfort zones.
As we’ve established, Architects are confident in their abilities and their knowledge. This
trait can help Architects charm a potential partner or get ahead on the career ladder.
Architects should take care, however, that their natural confidence does not alienate
others by coming across as arrogant or condescending. Architects should also resist their
tendency to assume that they are more intelligent and more rational than other people,
and they would do well to pause and question themselves whenever they offhandedly
dismiss criticism or pushback. A mindset of superiority prevents personal growth and
development, severely limiting the Architect’s prospects. Mature and wise Architects can
achieve truly amazing things, but only if they recognize the limits of their abilities and
knowledge.
Whereas some personality types base their self-esteem on material possessions, fame, or
number of Facebook friends, Architects are often self-sufficient and can be perfectly happy
being alone with their mind. That mind is their most precious gift and their most prized
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Personal Growth  51

possession. As a result, Architects tend to—and more often than not, need to—believe that
that they are right, and they can become defensive when they sense they may be wrong.
Although natural, this approach can limit personal growth and endanger relationships.
Architects should recognize that even they can make mistakes or fall prey to cognitive
biases. Again, recognizing one’s faults and limitations—not unrelenting confidence—is the
path to growth and self-improvement.
In this vein, it is important for Architects to accept that their intellectual capacity can be
enhanced through connection and collaboration with other people. Most Architects take
pride in their personal mindset and perspective, but they shouldn’t deafen themselves to
the perspectives of people who are different—even those who are less knowledgeable in
particular areas. Architects must take care to prevent their self-assurance from outpacing
their curiosity. In the words of Socrates: “I know one thing, that I know nothing.”
Thanks to Architects’ sharp minds and unquenchable desire to improve things, another
typical weakness is perfectionism. This trait may spur Architects to achieve great things,
but it can become disastrous in personal relationships. No partner or relationship will ever
be perfect, and it is crucial that Architects, especially Turbulent ones, do not get lost in
never-ending thoughts about how this or that could be improved. No matter how difficult
this may seem, Architects need to learn how to accept and enjoy things as they are rather
than seeing a relationship as yet another personal improvement project. Furthermore,
Architects are prone to seeing so many opportunities around themselves that it may
become very difficult to focus on one single goal.
As rational creatures, Architects face difficulties when it comes to emotions and sensitivity.
They find it problematic to both express and understand feelings, which can cause
significant problems in their relationships. An Architect may even take pride in being
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Personal Growth  52
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
unemotional, seeing feelings as illogical and inferior to rational thoughts. Emotions form
a crucial part of anyone’s personality, however, and it is imperative to recognize their
importance and value.
It is a myth that Architects do not experience emotions. Instead, the trait responsible for
emotional expression and recognition is underdeveloped in Architects, giving way to
rational thinking. Architects are by no means cold-hearted robots, nor should they be.
In our surveys, Architects often confess that they have poor social skills. Why do so many
Architects struggle in this area? As Analysts, Architects have both Intuitive and Thinking
traits, a combination that predisposes them to the world of ideas and principles rather
than everyday details. Small talk, gossip, sports, and the quirks of daily life (“Guess what I
saw at the bus stop this morning…”) hold little interest for people in this group. As a result,
they may struggle to find conversational common ground with others.
Among the Analyst personality types, Architects have the greatest difficulty with small talk.
As Introverts, Architects prefer introspection and being alone rather than relying on
external connections. Architects also prefer Judging to Prospecting when it comes to
tactics, and these traits prompt them to seek closure instead of simply going with the flow
of conversation. The combination of these traits can cause awkwardness in social
situations, especially if the other person doesn’t take the lead. Because they’re aware of
their difficulties in this area, Architects may experience anxiety well in advance of social
events.
That said, the ability to make small talk can be developed just like any other skill, and
Architects can draw on their aptitude for developing and executing strategies in order to
tackle this challenge. We won’t go into specific advice here, as there’s plenty of advice
available online. (For instance, Lifehack suggests focusing on F.O.R.M. in small talk: Family,
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Personal Growth  53
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Occupation, Recreation and Money.) Through a combination of research and practice,
Architects can develop conversational skills that will make them more confident and
relaxed in social settings.
It is worth emphasizing that small talk serves many uses aside from filling time at cocktail
parties. Small talk can serve as a gateway to meaningful conversation, offer a glimpse into
another person’s personality, or make a conversation partner feel valued. In other words,
there are plenty of reasons to develop this skill.
Of course, there exists an entire spectrum of social skills aside from small talk, and
Architects excel in other areas. Architects can be eloquent and convincing when they speak
about something that greatly interests them, for example, and they are unlikely to have
any difficulties when talking with a fellow Analyst.
Managing Emotions
Architects pride themselves on their ability to remain rational and logical. Many Architects
consider emotional displays to be signs of weakness, and some claim not to have any
feelings or emotions at all. As a result, Architects often experience difficulty handling
feelings and emotions, and they risk being viewed by others as brusque or insensitive.
Public displays of emotion are uncomfortable for most Architects, so they do their best to
restrain themselves and maintain their reserve. This doesn’t mean that Architects have no
feelings, however. In fact, Architects can be just as emotional as any other personality type,
if not more so. They just tend to use logic to keep their emotions in check. Architects prefer
to deal with emotions internally, without exposing them to the outside world, which is why
they may radiate an aura of coolness or detachment. In cases where they don’t feel as
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Personal Growth  54
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
confident as they’d like, Architects often retreat behind their rationality, allowing their
Thinking trait to act like a shield for their emotions.
Logic and rationality dominate the Architect decision-making process, so feelings usually
come into play when an Architect’s Thinking trait cannot come up with a rational solution
to a difficult issue. That said, emotions will always influence decisions, at least to some
extent. It is impossible to separate the two, even though most Architects try to make
decisions and solve problems without involving their feelings.
It’s worth emphasizing that Architects can be very sensitive and feel deeply. Although they
may try to shield their emotions and try to keep their feelings from influencing their
decisions, they are not cold-blooded, nor should they try to be.
Your Dark Side
Each personality type has its dark side, which may emerge under conditions of extreme
stress, fatigue, or frustration. This “evil twin” can manifest itself as the complete opposite
of an individual’s personality, throwing underdeveloped shadow traits into the light.
Outwardly, it may seem as if someone has decided to adopt a radically different approach
to their career, romantic relationships, habits, and so on. Inside, that person is likely to feel
confused or torn between two separate worldviews.
Such a change isn’t necessarily sudden or short-lived. Someone may choose, either
consciously or unconsciously, to live out their dark side for a very long time—in reaction
to overprotective parents, for example, or bad memories. This is why an exemplary
student might leave his or her parents’ house and become a party animal in college; a
sociable, friendly guy might become an extremist in reaction to a senseless crime
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Personal Growth  55

committed against his close friend; or a quiet, conservative girl may break out of her shell
and become more liberal after a bad breakup.
Someone whose “dark side” includes traits that are generally seen as positive—for
example, spontaneity, sensitivity, or willingness to take risks—may receive encouragement
from his or her social circle. This encouragement may even lead that person to assume
that these new traits are their “true” personality or self, whereas previously they were
repressing their “real” self.
Architects are not exempt from this rule. Their “evil twin,” which is an unhealthy version of
the Entertainer (ESFP, -A/-T) personality, disposes them toward emotional outbursts,
obsessing over social status, engaging in pointless repetitive activities, befriending random
strangers, drinking, and gambling. These behaviors may feel liberating or strangely
energizing at times, but they will likely be followed by feelings of emptiness and confusion.
It is worth noting, however, that Architects tend to have better self-control than the other
three Analyst types. They can relax and have fun from time to time, but comparatively,
they are not too keen on doing fun things that are bad for them, even in moderation.
Now that you’re familiar with your personality makeup as an Architect, you can ask yourself
whether your behavior in a given situation is a true reflection of your inner self, or only a
temporary overcompensation in reaction to something—an effort to rebel against
authority, for example, or break out of your shell. Pick up a blank sheet of paper and a
pen, sit down, and reflect on your purpose in life. What do you deeply want to create,
experience, or achieve in 5, 10, or 20 years? Write down everything, even thoughts that
seem random. You will definitely know when you have written something in line with your
purpose; it may even make you cry. That will be a reflection of your true self.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Personal Growth  56

Just recognizing that each of us has a dark side will enable you to spot when that “switch”
has been flipped, either in yourself or in someone close to you. Otherwise, you may be
drawn into a never-ending spiral of cheating yourself and neglecting your purpose.
The Fifth Element
Another important influence on Architects’ personal growth is their type variant, or Identity
trait. We discussed this briefly in the Introduction, but it is worth exploring it in depth.
Most people lie close to the middle on this particular scale, but the results are influenced
by gender and social environment. For instance, women are more likely to have a
Turbulent identity, especially if they live in the Western world. Our studies have also shown
geographical differences within the U.S., with the East Coast being significantly more
Turbulent than the West Coast.15
Assertive Architects are comfortable with their identity. They recognize and leverage their
strengths wherever possible. Although they may be somewhat perfectionistic, they
understand that no one is perfect and no project is worth obsessing over. Similarly, they
remain calm and focused in stressful situations, and they don’t feel threatened by minor
challenges. Architects tend to be good at controlling their emotions, but Assertive
Architects go further by refusing to internalize them. This means that even deep down,
they are not really affected by either negative or positive emotions. They rarely get
stressed or excited, instead staying calm and composed at all times.
The Assertive identity has its downsides, however. Assertive Architects often sidestep self-
consciousness and “emotional roller coasters,” but these ups and downs can actually

facilitate personal development. Because they are less sensitive to negative outcomes,
Assertive Architects may have decreased drive and productivity. They may also alienate
themselves from others due to their forceful, unshakeable self-confidence.
Turbulent Architects, on the other hand, experience anxiety about their performance and
fret over the consequences of their actions. As an Architect, they are still fairly confident in
their abilities, knowledge, and resourcefulness. Chances are, however, that they suffer
from perfectionism and internalize the resulting stress and worry.
Although they might try not to reveal their sensitivity, Turbulent Architects care deeply
about how others perceive them (or even how their ideal self would perceive them). This
can lead to certain “emotional roller coasters”: as long as all goes well, Architects may feel
at the top of the world, but when forced to face their weaknesses or confront the possibility
of failure, they plunge into the abyss. Turbulent identity results in higher stress levels,
which can lead to health problems if left unaddressed.
There are certain advantages to having a Turbulent identity, however. Because Turbulent
Architects are more success-driven and self-conscious than their Assertive cousins, they
can potentially achieve better results and become more motivated to improve themselves.
Turbulent Architects, who constantly stop to evaluate and re-evaluate themselves, may
experience less meteoric rises than their Assertive counterparts, but their successes are
less likely to suddenly crash down. As their own worst critics, Turbulent Architects accept
new responsibilities reluctantly, and thus are unlikely to overpromise and underperform.
Whether you are an Assertive or a Turbulent Architect, your potential for success and
happiness depends on your willingness and ability to address the challenges posed by
your identity type. Each side has its advantages and disadvantages, although generally you
should move toward the middle of this scale in order to achieve optimal results and grow

as an individual. If you have an Assertive identity, try setting more difficult goals for
yourself and occasionally giving in to your emotions. If you have a Turbulent identity, resist
internalizing stress or negative emotions, and revise your expectation of yourself to be a
superhuman who can never fail.

Romantic Relationships
Architect personalities often experience significant difficulties when it comes to
relationships and dating. Because Architects spend a large part of their lives in their heads,
they may find it challenging to reconcile their worldview, fantasies, and expectations with
reality. Unfortunately, their superior logic and imagination may actually hinder Architects
when they start looking for a partner.
Architects often expect any potential partners to share their rational approach to life. As a
result, Architects may be dismayed to find that most people follow dating conventions—
like waiting a certain number of hours or days before returning a text—that aren’t
especially logical. Architects often become disappointed after a few attempts at dating,
and they may even start thinking that most prospective partners are either irrational or
intellectually inferior.
As most Architects have difficulties with dating and relationships, their self-confidence
takes a major hit in those situations. They then overcompensate by showing off their
intelligence, which makes them even less appealing to potential partners. Only when
Architects return to their usual selves does their self-confidence start glowing again, which
makes it much easier for them to attract a partner. Paradoxically, Architects are most likely
to attract a romantic partner when they are not actually looking for one.
When dating, Architects keep their eyes open, scanning the environment for potential
mates, but their approach and criteria will likely be different from that of the rest of the
population. Many other types prioritize physical attractiveness, social status, or
communication skills when appraising a potential mate. Architects rarely care about these
things. In contrast, they home in on the other person’s intelligence, rationality, and
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  60

wisdom. Architects have no patience for individuals whom they perceive as shallow, and
they loathe dating games and “rules.” Architects want to find someone who understands
and appreciates their ideas—a desire that most other types would find odd or unromantic.
Because their standards and values are so unique, Architects may be branded as picky or
snobbish by people who are used to getting attention for their looks or status.
As far as their approach, some Architects may try to compensate for the poor social skills
by throwing jokes, but more often than not they focus on intellectual or even scientific
topics. After all, Architects’ knowledge and reasoning skills are nearly always miles ahead
of their social skills.
Architect personalities often come up with checklists of intellectual and physical traits they
would like their partners to have or obtain. The problem is that those requirements may
be quite unrealistic. People with this personality type need to find the middle ground
between having overly strict criteria and settling on the first person who expresses interest
in them.
Architects prefer to act from their knowledge and their understanding, and situations
where they must express their feelings or face the emotions of others can cause them
significant discomfort. Not surprisingly, Architects can inadvertently hurt other people,
especially during the dating phase and even later in the relationship. Architects may view
interpersonal conflicts as logical puzzles worthy of analysis, rather than honoring their and
their partner’s emotions and sensitivities.
That said, Architects’ feelings run very deep and can be powerful, but they may not be
expressed in conventional ways. If an Architect does convey affection through cuddling,
kissing, and saying "I love you" every couple of minutes, it is not because of personal
preference, but because they have learned that their partner expects these signs of love.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  61

Generally, Architects are wonderful mates—loyal, honest, and eager to work on improving
the relationship.
In conflict situations, Architects look for logical solutions, thanks to their underlying
conviction that every problem has a solution. They approach each conflict from a cool,
rational perspective, analyzing what led to the situation and addressing the root cause. An
Architect will not jump in to offer emotional support, though, unless they determine that
this is what they must do to resolve the conflict.
Sexually, Architects are imaginative and enthusiastic, provided that their partner is willing
to reciprocate. It is important that the Architect does not fall into the habit of spending
more time theorizing about intimacy than communicating with their partner. People with
this personality type, especially female Architects, need to be aroused mentally as much
as physically in order to be fully stimulated. For Architects, lack of intelligence and lack of
intellectual connection is a big turn-off.
If they believe a relationship is breaking down, people with the Architect personality type
often take the reins and end the relationship before it can disintegrate further. Their
approach to dating is similar: they will not keep trying to connect with someone if the
likelihood of a strong relationship seems low. Architects’ cool, decisive demeanors can be
deceiving, however. They may feel hurt inside and spend extensive amounts of time
figuring out what went wrong, especially if they had devoted a great deal of time to dating
or making the relationship work.
When it comes to breakups, Architects’ ability to rationalize everything is both a blessing
and a curse. If there seems to be a clear reason behind a break-up, the Architect will
continue with their life quite easily, despite the hurt. If the Architect cannot find a rational
explanation, however, they will have more difficulty moving on. They might assume that

their partner was irrational and that all relationships are doomed by illogic, or they might
berate themselves for not being insightful enough to identify the real reason behind the
breakup.
Deep and intelligent, Architects bring stability and insight to their romantic relationships,
but as we’ve established that extraordinary intelligence is their main liability in this area. If
both partners manage to survive the rocky start during the dating phase, the Architect will
do everything he or she can to keep the relationship strong and healthy, as long as the
partner reciprocates.
Potential Trait Pairings
Let us now consider how potential trait pairings work in romantic relationships. Each
combination of traits lends different dynamics to the relationship—sometimes positive
and sometimes negative—so knowing what to expect will help you further down the road.
Of course, each individual is unique, and what is true for one may not be true for another.
Ultimately, you will be responsible for figuring out what exact role these traits play in your
relationship.
An Introverted Partner
The best thing about a relationship with another Introvert is that you both are likely to be
self-sufficient, with a shared appreciation for spending time alone. Without a strong need
to be around other people, you can take pleasure in simply talking with each other, and
neither of you will mind staying at home sometimes rather than going out. As Introverts,
you will have been pressured to go out and socialize numerous times in your lives. Your
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  63

relationship will be free from this pressure, and in all likelihood, just a few close friends
will fulfill your socialization needs.
You and your partner will also be in a good position when it comes to resolving problems
in the relationship. As Introverts, you can draw on introspection and reflection to identify
potential solutions, rather than losing yourselves in the discussion process.
Introverted partners can face difficulties, however. You may encounter situations where
neither partner draws out the other, or where neither partner takes the lead in an
important social event, such as a family member’s wedding. Despite being Introverts, you
will need to venture out and socialize to avoid feeling isolated. If you and your partner are
both used to dodging social interaction, finding the energy or drive to go out may be
difficult.
You and your partner may also find it difficult to communicate about difficult topics. If you
both tend toward introspection and prefer to keep your thoughts to yourselves, you will
encounter situations where one of you allows your negative feelings or dissatisfactions to
fester and grow. For the health of the relationship, you will have to consciously work to air
small grievances before they turn into significant resentments.
Tips for both individuals:
1. Be patient. Your potential partner may need time to open up to you.
2. When dating, choose locations without much social pressure. Your potential
partner may feel uncomfortable with many other people around.
3. Do not overcompensate. Small talk is unavoidable in the dating phase, but you are
unlikely to be good at it. Do not overcompensate by forcing yourself to be chatty
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  64

and sociable or pushing your potential partner to talk. At best, you will look insecure
and the other person will feel uncomfortable.
4. Speak up. Once you transition into a relationship, remind yourself to share your
thoughts with your partner instead of keeping everything to yourself.
Communication is key in an Introvert–Introvert relationship.
5. Do not get stuck in a bubble. You may both have difficulties when it comes to
socializing with others. Gently draw each other out of your shells, rather than falsely
reassuring each other that such interaction is completely unnecessary.
An Extraverted Partner
The best thing about a relationship with someone who does not share your first trait is
that you will balance each other out. As an Introvert, you will encourage your partner to
slow down and reflect before jumping into action. Your partner, on the other hand, will
draw you out, establishing new social links and taking care of any social obligations.
These differences can also help resolve conflicts in the relationship, with the Extravert
forcing difficult conversations to happen and the Introvert bringing their reflective listening
skills to the table. As long as both partners listen to each other and accept differences in
your viewpoints, you will be able to draw on each other’s strengths while countering each
other’s weaknesses.
That said, personality differences can sometimes challenge the stability and health of the
relationship. You may struggle to understand each other’s perspectives. In such
circumstances, the Extravert may get frustrated by the Introvert’s reserve or reticence, and
the Introvert may get annoyed by the Extravert’s chattiness or need to socialize.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  65
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
It is crucial that both of you make conscious efforts to understand each other and not view
your partner’s preferences as strange or abnormal. Chances are that you consider your
own traits as normal or desirable, and you may even surround yourself with friends who
are like you. To escape this bubble, push your limits and try to see the world through
another person’s eyes. When an Introvert and an Extravert form a relationship, they give
each other an excellent opportunity to do just this.
Tips for you:
1. Do not overcompensate. Small talk is unavoidable in the dating phase, but you are
unlikely to enjoy or excel at it. Do not overcompensate by trying to appear chatty
and sociable. Let the Extravert take the lead. Otherwise, you will seem fake or
insecure.
2. Speak up. Once you transition into a relationship, share your thoughts with your
partner rather than sticking to your habit of keeping things to yourself.
3. Do not get stuck in a bubble. Your Extraverted partner will probably take the lead
in social situations, but you should still contribute to conversations and connect with
others.
4. Be tolerant. Your partner may not understand your need for alone time. Because
Extraverts recharge by spending time with other people, your partner may not know
that you need exactly the opposite, and he or she might even worry that you’re upset
or angry when you withdraw to spend time on your own. Take time to explain to
your partner how your mind works.
Tips for your partner:
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  66
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
1. Be patient. Your potential partner may need time to open up to you.
2. When dating, choose locations without much social pressure. Your potential
partner may feel uncomfortable with many other people around.
3. Do not be overbearing. Small talk is often uncomfortable for Introverts. Do not
force your potential partner to talk extensively about himself or herself.
4. Be tolerant. Your partner may feel drained after socializing with other people—or
even with you—for an extensive amount of time. Remember that Introverts are
exhausted by social interaction, unlike you, who are recharged by it. There will be
times when your partner will want to be alone. Give them space, and don’t worry
that something is wrong. Your Introvert simply needs some time alone to recharge.
An Intuitive Partner
As Intuitives, you and your partner prefer introspection to observation. In other words,
you both spend time exploring the world of ideas rather than keeping your feet on the
ground. A relationship between two Intuitives is an amazing thing to observe, as the
partners often develop a connection that allows them to understand each other without
words. The combination of intuition, introspection, and imagination is likely to be a great
driving force in your relationship.
Intuitives are relatively rare (only 15–25% of the population), so the fact that you managed
to find another Intuitive is impressive in itself. Chances are that you felt an instantaneous
connection as well as the wonderful relief of finally finding someone who understands you.
It is quite unlikely that two Intuitives will run out of things to talk about, which is a great
advantage both in the dating phase and later on in the relationship. Your relationship may
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  67
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
also be a welcome break from all the comments you’ve received in the past about having
your head in the clouds.
It is often the practical matters that cause problems in Intuitive–Intuitive relationships. As
both partners favor novel issues, ideas, and future plans, one of them will inevitably have
to take the lead and handle the concrete things, such as shopping, cooking, maintenance,
and money management. Intuitives tend not to be proactive about these matters, and this
may cause tension in the relationship.
Another problem you may face is a tendency toward groundlessness. Intuitives often get
lost in their world of ideas and possibilities, drifting from one idea, vision, or concept to
another. While this is a wonderful trait when it comes to creativity and innovation, it can
cause significant problems in a relationship. It is important to take time to enjoy the
present and the simple things in life; otherwise, both partners may feel overwhelmed and
tired all the time. Keep your eyes on the stars, but also remember to see and appreciate
the present moment.
Tips for both individuals:
1. Deal with practical tasks. Neither partner is likely to enjoy (or be good at) handling
routine, daily tasks. To avoid a buildup of problems or stressors, however, it is
important to deal with these things on time.
2. Do things that engage your creativity. You both find fulfillment in the world of
ideas and creativity, so don’t push yourself or your partner to participate in activities
that don’t engage your Intuitive side—even if those activities are touted as “great
date ideas” by other people.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  68
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
3. Be realistic. As Intuitives, you will both have plenty of ideas, expectations, and
desires that may or may not be realistic. Do not overcommit yourselves.
4. Enjoy the present. You are both likely to spend time thinking about and projecting
yourself into the future. Time is precious, so find a way to enjoy the present as well.
5. Share your ideas. Imagination is one of your greatest assets, so use it. Your partner
will see some things from a different perspective, while at the same time staying on
the same wavelength as you.
An Observant Partner
This combination is among the most challenging, but it has its potential rewards.
Our Energy traits—Intuitive or Observant—determine how we see the world, how we think,
and how we communicate. In some relationships, the schism between Intuitive and
Observant traits is too daunting, and both partners may stress over why they can’t easily
connect and communicate. In other relationships, both partners are able to acknowledge
their differences and turn them into strengths, thus neutralizing each other’s weaknesses.
The main difference between Intuitive and Observant traits is easy to define. As an
Intuitive, you focus on unconventional, visionary matters: ideas, possibilities, dreams,
patterns, connections, and so on. Intuitives are imaginers who think more about the future
than the present. Your Observant partner, on the other hand, will prioritize practical
things: objects, observation, facts, and daily matters. Observant types are doers who focus
on the present moment rather than the future. Not surprisingly, these traits have wide-
reaching effects, from observational abilities to communication styles.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  69
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
In an Intuitive–Observant relationship, it is absolutely crucial that you both take time to
understand how the other person thinks and processes things. It is also worth noting that
Observant personality types dominate society, which may lead to Intuitives’ traits being
dismissed as impractical or unrealistic. Observant partners should avoid labeling Intuitives
as “odd” or getting frustrated because “this is not what most people do.” Respect each
other’s differences.
If all goes well, however, you are likely to have a very rewarding relationship. As an Intuitive,
you will inspire your significant other and come up with a myriad of interesting ideas,
always keeping the relationship fresh and interesting. Your Observant partner will ensure
that those ideas are grounded in reality and keep an eye on practical matters. As always,
communication is key in such relationships. There will be plenty of misunderstandings,
especially at the beginning, but these disconnections are unlikely to cause lasting damage
if both partners are open-minded and willing to compromise.
Tips for you:
1. Be patient. Your Observant partner is likely to have difficulties understanding some
of your ideas.
2. Improve your observation skills. Your imagination is a great asset, but it is not
going to help when, for example, you have to remember your partner’s favorite
perfume or where you put the car keys.
3. Keep your feet on the ground. Intuitives often overestimate their abilities,
enthusiastically embracing new and exciting ideas and opportunities without
considering the actual implementation.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  70
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
4. Remember to enjoy the present. You are likely to spend too much time thinking
about the future. Find a way to enjoy the present as well. Your Observant partner
will certainly be able to help you with this.
Tips for your partner:
1. Be patient. Your Intuitive partner is likely to have difficulties handling practical tasks
or noticing things.
2. Improve your introspection skills. Although you are practical, proactive, and
realistic, it is also often necessary to spend some time reflecting on things. Forget
the practical world and let yourself dream every once in a while.
3. Be imaginative. Observant types often focus too much on routines or physical
things. Embrace your imagination and do not be afraid of exploring ideas that may
or not be practical or implementable.
4. Think about the future. You are likely to focus either on the past or the present.
Find some time to think about the future as well, no matter how scary this may be.
This does not mean that you need to make complex long-term plans. Instead, simply
imagine and explore possibilities in your mind. Your Intuitive partner is probably
doing this all the time, so try to meet each other halfway.
A Thinking Partner
A Thinker–Thinker relationship is usually free from dramas and emotional arguments.
There will be disagreements, but they will take the form of calm, factual discussions rather
than emotional storms. This doesn’t necessarily mean that your disagreements will be
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  71
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
easier to overcome than arguments between other personality types, but your arguments
will have a more even tenor.
It is worth reiterating that Thinkers aren’t unemotional. Both Thinkers and Feelers are
capable of deep feelings, but Thinkers tend to hide those feelings from the outside world.
Regardless of the circumstances, they want to stay in control and not lose their heads. This
may create an aura of indifference, but do not assume that your partner is completely
calm and happy just because he or she isn’t showing strong emotions.
The main challenge in Thinker–Thinker relationships is expression of feelings. In all
likelihood, you and your partner are both used to internalizing your feelings and protecting
your inner emotional landscape. This works well in a professional environment, but
romantic relationships come with a different set of requirements. At times, you will have
to support your partner emotionally, express your feelings for him or her, or simply offer
encouragement.
These behaviors may not come naturally to you, and they may even make you feel
vulnerable. It is important, however, that both you and your partner make conscious
efforts to open up from time to time and showing what you truly feel.
Tips for both individuals:
1. Do not be afraid to share your feelings. You do not have to pretend that you are
a highly rational robot in order to earn respect. Expressing your feelings is perfectly
fine.
2. Be open-minded. As Thinkers, you may find it difficult to tolerate a point of view
that contradicts the facts you know. Accept that your partner’s opinions may differ
from yours.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  72
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
3. Be careful with criticism. As Thinkers, you may be resistant to criticism, but don’t
dish it out every time your partner makes a minor mistake. Remember: even if
partner doesn’t react emotionally to your criticism, he or she may still be hurt.
4. Know how to relax. There is no need to act reserved when having fun with your
partner. Don’t worry too much about whether everything makes sense.
A Feeling Partner
A Thinker–Feeler relationship can be extremely rewarding, as each partner can teach the
other how to look at things from an entirely different perspective. It is crucial, however,
that both you and your partner understand and respect your differences, or else you may
end up volleying unjustified criticism back and forth. In these situations, the Thinker
complains that their partner is emotional or irrational, and the Feeler responds that the
Thinker is cold and heartless. Because of social expectations and gender stereotypes, such
criticism becomes even more damaging if the Thinker is a woman and the Feeler is a man.
Again, both Thinkers and Feelers are capable of deep feelings. Thinkers tend to hide those
feelings from the outside world, however, and regardless of the circumstances, they want
to stay in control of their emotional response. As we’ve mentioned, this tendency may give
them an aura of indifference.
Likewise, a Feeling person isn’t irrational. He or she is simply acting according to different
values, placing harmony and sensitivity above cold, hard facts. Even though they show
their feelings openly, their decision process can still be perfectly rational.
Both Thinking and Feeling perspectives are perfectly valid, and this is one of the most
important lessons you will have to learn in your relationship. If both partners are tolerant
and open-minded, a Thinker–Feeler relationship can be inspiring and successful, with the
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  73
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Thinker making fact-based decisions and the Feeler bringing warmth and harmony into
the relationship.
Tips for you:
1. Be tolerant. Remember that your partner may not value the facts as much as you
do. He or she is likely to prioritize harmony, values, and ethical principles.
2. Observe. Your partner is likely to be good at gauging other people’s emotional
states, and he or she may expect the same from you. Try to learn how to read your
partner’s cues.
3. Be careful with criticism. Feelers tend to be vulnerable to criticism. When you
make suggestions or point out mistakes, be careful to do so in a gentle, non-
confrontational manner.
4. Know how to relax. There is no need to act reserved when having fun with your
partner. Don’t worry too much about whether everything makes sense.
Tips for your partner:
1. Be tolerant. Remember that your partner may be more interested in facts than
feelings. He or she will likely focus on finding a rational solution rather than taking
others’ emotions into account.
2. Stay calm. Try not to take criticism personally. In some cases, your partner will
simply be criticizing an idea or assessing a situation as opposed to pointing out your
flaws.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  74
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
3. Observe. Do not assume that your partner is completely calm and happy just
because he or she isn’t showing emotion.
4. Be patient. In all likelihood, your partner will not be as good as you at gauging other
people’s emotional states. There will be times when he or she will misunderstand
your emotions or become frustrated by how difficult it is to deduce what you feel.
Thinkers are used to dealing with data, not emotions.
A Judging Partner
Judgers enjoy planning and committing to things as opposed to keeping their options
open. If you and your partner share this trait, it is unlikely that you will have difficulties
making up your minds and sticking to specific goals. As Judgers, you are likely to be
dedicated and patient partners, putting your duties above pleasure. You will both work
hard on the relationship and readily commit to future plans. This will contribute greatly to
the stability of your relationship, with both partners always staying on track and focusing
on what has to be done.
That said, planning and scheduling require a degree of inflexibility, and this can cause
tension in the relationship. Not surprisingly, two Judgers may often clash with each other,
with their need for closure demanding a clear solution and a clear path forward at all times.
There may also be times when you make conflicting commitments without checking with
each other first.
Another potential problem is that you may both find it difficult to change your habits or
long-held views. Judgers are likely to defend their opinions quite fiercely, unwilling to give
up and accept a different point of view. This can cause friction in the relationship, and it
can also prevent you from recognizing new options and opportunities. Beyond that,
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  75

shaking things up can bring welcome variety and novelty into the relationship. From
hobbies to holiday plans, don’t be afraid to experiment or be more spontaneous every
once in a while.
Unlike Prospecting types, who are generally more relaxed about duties and deadlines,
Judgers experience significant stress when things do not go according to plan. Learn to be
flexible, abandon your plans, and relax your work ethic when a situation demands it. For
the health of your relationship, you will have to find a balance between stability and
spontaneity.
Tips for both individuals:
1. Be open-minded. As Judgers, you may find it challenging to accept others’ views
and opinions. Try not to be stubborn and argumentative in cases where you
disagree.
2. Experiment. Your tendency to plan and prepare may cause problems when a
situation calls for experimenting or trying something new. Learn to let go from time
to time.
3. Do not exhaust yourselves. Your desire to get things done can bring a lot of stress
into your own life and into the relationship. Try stepping back and relaxing. The
world won’t collapse if you miss a self-imposed deadline.
4. Find time for each other. Don’t get so caught up in plans, tasks, and obligations
that you lose sight of what is truly important. Being playful and having fun can be
just as important—if not more so—than yet another task. All work and no play will
not sustain a relationship.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  76

A Prospecting Partner
In contrast to Judging types, Prospecting ones like to keep their options open, always
looking for alternatives and opportunities. A relationship between a Judger and a
Prospector will be challenging unless both partners take time to explore and understand
each other’s differences.
The main source of frustration in this relationship will be your opposing views on making
and executing plans. As a Judger, you will develop an agenda and try to stick with it at all
costs. As a Prospector, your partner will prefer to proceed more flexibly and
spontaneously—perhaps even abandoning a project once the most interesting task has
been completed.
There are also potential upsides to a Judger–Prospector relationship. The tension created
by the Judger’s inflexibility can be defused by the easygoing Prospector. Likewise, your
drive and sense of order can counterbalance your partner’s tendency to be indecisive or
to ignore tasks that aren’t fun or enjoyable. As long as both partners refrain from name-
calling and compromise, the differences between you can become major strengths, as you
each balance the other’s weaknesses.
In order to achieve this harmony, you should strive to meet each other halfway. As the
Judging partner, you should experiment or be more spontaneous every once in a while,
even if that means altering your habits or long-held views. Similarly, your Prospecting
partner should resist the urge to seek novelty and to escape necessary plans or chores.
There needs to be a balance between your stability and your partner’s spontaneity, and
you will both have to decide where that balance is in your relationship.
Tips for you:
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  77
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
1. Communicate. Your partner’s indecisiveness or relaxed attitude will often frustrate
you. Do not resort to name-calling, and try to understand what drives your partner
and how you can both support each other. Remember that your partner may not
be as interested in plans and schedules as you are.
2. Be open-minded. As a Judger, you may struggle to accept others’ views. Try not to
be stubborn and argumentative in cases where your partner disagrees with you.
3. Experiment. Although your preference is to plan and prepare, remember that some
situations require experimenting or trying something new. Learn to let go and act
spontaneously from time to time.
4. Do not exhaust yourself. Your desire to get things done can cause stress—both
for yourself and for your partner. Practice relaxing and adopting a flexible attitude
toward some of your self-imposed deadlines.
Tips for your partner:
1. Communicate. Your partner’s inflexibility and need to plan will often frustrate you.
Do not resort to name-calling. Instead, try to understand your partner and how you
can support each other. Remember that your partner is used to valuing plans and
schedules above play and rest. He or she may find it difficult to step back and relax.
2. Focus. As a Prospector, you probably enjoy trying new things and changing
direction. Learn to finish to your tasks and honor your responsibilities.
3. Watch your environment. You may have a much higher tolerance for disorder
than your Judging partner. Do not ignore your housekeeping duties.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  78
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
4. Do not be picky. Prospectors tend to balk at routine, menial tasks. You might be
tempted to turn your attention to something more exciting, but you should make
conscious efforts to do your fair share of household duties.
Assertive or Turbulent?
This final trait determines how confident we are in our abilities and decisions, which
certainly affects our behavior in romantic relationships. Because this is a personality
variant rather than an integral part of the type, this section is structured differently than
those you’ve just read. That said, the significance of this dynamic shouldn’t be
underestimated.
Assertive individuals tend to be emotionally stable and even-keeled. Their calm
temperament allows them to address disagreements and problems without much stress.
Individuals with this personality trait tend to be optimistic and content—both about their
achievements and about life in general. That said, this self-assurance can make Assertive
individuals lax about pursuing goals or recognizing opportunities for self-improvement in
their relationships.
Turbulent individuals, on the other hand, are more self-conscious and more reactive to
stress. They experience emotional roller coasters, perhaps feeling on top of the world in
the morning but then overrun by negativity in the evening. Success-driven and
perfectionistic, Turbulent types feel anxiety about their achievements, their worthiness,
and how others perceive them. Although stressful, these high expectations can bring
Turbulent individuals great career success and motivate them to bring their best selves to
a relationship.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  79

You might expect that people with the Assertive experience greater success in
relationships. After all, what’s not to like about being self-confident and relaxed?
Resistance to stress and pressure doesn’t necessarily translate into success, however, even
in romance. Turbulent individuals are more reflective and organized than their Assertive
counterparts, often pushing themselves harder than necessary. It is exactly this “must do
better” attitude that drives them to devote time and energy to their relationships.
Turbulent people are also more thoughtful in their decision-making process and less
prone to careless mistakes.
In other words, neither trait is preferable to the other. A successful relationship will
ultimately require you to address your own weaknesses and to consider how your traits
may complement or clash with your partner’s.
Let’s briefly discuss the three potential combinations between Assertive and Turbulent
partners. Remember that the dynamics we describe below will depend on how strongly
Assertive or Turbulent each person is. The higher the score, the starker these
characteristics will be.
Assertive + Assertive
This may be the most straightforward combination. You and your partner are likely to be
confident, relaxed optimists, happy with the relationship and where it is going. You may
rarely experience strong positive emotions, but you won’t have many negative ones either.
You are probably content with your work and social status, and you trust your own desires
and intuition rather than fretting about others’ opinions.
Although it may be pleasant, beware your tendency to assume that everything is all right.
Otherwise, you may miss early warning signs and end up with bigger issues down the road.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  80
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Too much confidence can be just as hazardous as too little. Even if everything seems great,
take time to reflect on the big picture and identify areas for improvement.
Assertive + Turbulent
As with all other traits, partners on opposite sides of the scale can either clash with each
other or help each other grow. In such relationships, it is important to understand each
other’s strengths and weaknesses, rather than assume something is wrong with the other
person’s attitude or worldview.
If you are the Assertive individual in a relationship, you should recognize that your
Turbulent partner is more emotionally reactive than you and more vulnerable to stressful
situations. He or she may also be pessimistic, anxious, or shy. That said, your partner
probably thinks deeply about his or her decisions and strives to improve your relationship
wherever possible. The example of your partner’s conscientiousness and drive may
counterbalance any apathy you feel. Even your partner’s emotional swings can be an asset
to the relationship, if he or she can master them and use them as a driving force.
If you are the Turbulent individual in your relationship, you should understand that your
partner’s calm, relaxed attitude doesn’t mean that he or she lacks interest in working on
the relationship. Assertive individuals may seem somewhat detached or blasé, especially
from your Turbulent perspective, and you might worry that your partner is too self-
confident or too easily satisfied by “good enough” results. Your partner’s emotional
stability can be a great asset to the relationship, however, and his or her level-headedness
is invaluable in emotionally charged or unpredictable situations.
With this in mind, you and your partner should resist the urge to focus on your differences
or try to change each other. Instead, work on covering each other’s weaknesses with your
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  81
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
respective strengths. The Assertive partner can act as an emotional bedrock by defusing
stressful situations, pointing out silver linings, and encouraging the Turbulent partner to
let go of perfectionism and take a bolder, riskier step every now and then.
The Turbulent partner, on the other hand, can bring more order, organization, and goal-
orientation to the relationship. He or she can push both partners to grow and develop
instead remaining content with where they are. The Turbulent partner can also act as a
safeguard in cases where the Assertive partner is tempted to make a risky, uninformed, or
impulsive decision.
Turbulent + Turbulent
This combination is the most tempestuous of all, with both partners falling on the
emotional and anxious side of the scale. While you will both experience strong positive
emotions, you will be subject to negative feelings as well. In these moments of stress and
negativity, you and your partner must remember to pause, take a few deep breaths, and
try to refocus your thoughts and emotions. Otherwise, you risk fueling each other’s
anxiety, with minor frustrations boiling over and becoming full-blown crises. Because
Turbulent individuals are so vulnerable to stress, you and your partner will need to actively
develop strategies to de-stress and relax together.
That said, the Turbulent trait can also work in your relationship’s favor. You will likely take
time to reflect on both the present and the future, adjusting your course as necessary
instead of functioning on autopilot. While this may lead to plenty of soul-searching
conversations about the many stressors in your lives, you will be motivated to address
these issues rather than ignoring them. Although the Turbulent trait can be a liability if you
don’t manage the resulting stress and anxiety, it can also enable your relationship to grow
and evolve.

Type Combinations
Now that we’ve addressed possible trait combinations, let’s take a look at the relationship
dynamics between different Roles. You might recall that each of the four Roles—Analyst,
Diplomat, Sentinel, and Explorer—contains a set of personality types that are very similar
to one another. As you’ll see, these Roles offer a helpful framework for understanding how
different personalities interact in relationships.
Analysts – Analysts
You’ve probably heard that “opposites attract”—as if the human heart were a magnet. So
what happens when two people within a personality group embark on a romance?
Fortunately, no two people are exactly alike, even if they do share the same basic
personality traits, so a relationship between two Analysts will hardly be like looking into a
mirror. Degrees of other traits, such as Introversion and Extraversion, will influence each
partner’s personality, and there can be plenty of other nuances and differences to keep
the relationship interesting.
Typically, Analysts come to a relationship with a list of expectations for their partner. It is
important to let go of these preconceptions. Even a fellow Analyst will behave illogically
sometimes, due to factors of personality and upbringing that are too complex to
understand on a rational level. In any relationship, Analysts must learn to embrace their
partners as they are rather than as they “should be.”
When two Analysts come together romantically, they will favor intellectual rather than
emotional stimulation. That’s not to say that Analysts are incapable of emotions or passion.
Expressing these feelings won’t be their strong suit, however, and they may feel
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  83
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
uncomfortable or disoriented in emotionally charged situations. Analysts may also
struggle to find a rationale for their love of affection, rather than accept that their feelings
exist beyond their conscious control. After all, sometimes the people we love don’t fulfill
every item on our preconceived checklists.
Despite these caveats, two Analysts can connect quite deeply over stimulating
conversations, common interests, and their intellectual drive. A dinner together will be less
about small talk and more about big ideas or hypothetical scenarios to explore. An Analyst
couple may even come to see their relationship as a refuge from the petty, inane world
they have to put up with outside of their relationship.
A fictional example of this might be Frank and Claire Underwood from the American
adaptation of House of Cards. No matter what has happened with his Machiavellian plots
during the day, Frank always returns home to his wife Claire, who understands him and
whose intellect is a match for his. For Frank and Claire, their partnership is a welcome
respite from their interactions with other people, whom they view as inferior. Although
this Analyst power couple may not have the most classically romantic relationship, they
are incredibly close, and they operate as a single unit. Most Analysts are nothing like the
morally challenged Frank and Claire, but this television couple reminds us that love can be
demonstrated in many ways—and not just through soft, romantic evenings.
Analysts have difficulty reading other people’s emotions, and their rigorous minds
automatically identify areas for improvement. Thanks to these two tendencies, Analyst
couples are at risk of continually analyzing their relationship in an effort to improve it. In
fact, they may spend more time deconstructing and rebuilding their connection than
actually experiencing it. It can be fine for some emotional distance to exist between two
people in an “intellectual” relationship, but romantic relationships are often messier and
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  84
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
more emotional than we expect, with a significant potential for hurt feelings. Analyst
partners will only worsen tense situations if they spar off with logic and argument rather
than offer each other empathy.
Organization can also be problematic for the Analyst couple. Because both partners are
Intuitive—preferring to think about novel, big-picture ideas and the future—who’s going
to make sure dinner is on the table every evening? Or even buy the groceries in the first
place? When two visionary types come together, practical matters may be neglected. A
systematic list of chores and household deadlines can be helpful in making sure that
everything gets done and that responsibilities are divided fairly.
Analyst couples may also be prone to overthinking their decisions. While it’s worth taking
the time to reflect on where the future may lead, few things are clear-cut in life, especially
where two or more people are involved. Analysts can feel utterly paralyzed in situations
where they don’t have enough information to be able to predict how a certain scenario is
likely to play out or where all available options are imperfect. Should they take the risk and
move to another state or country in search of better opportunities, for example? It’s easy
to imagine the Analyst couple spending countless evenings researching, brainstorming
and pacing back and forth in the dining room, nitpicking arguments for and against,
instead of taking the leap or discarding the plan altogether. And it doesn’t have to be major
life decisions either. A Saturday trip to a national park can have all the joy sucked out of it
just as successfully if the couple doesn’t learn to relax their mental muscles and tear up
their checklists every once in a while.
Analysts can be loyal, responsible, and stimulating partners, as long as they’re careful not
to be too exacting of each other. To grow together, Analyst couples should focus on
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  85
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
expanding their comfort zones, letting go of expectations, and adding some spontaneity
into their routines.
Tips for Analyst Couples:
 In your partner, you’ve found someone who understands your approach to the
world. Don’t be afraid to share your imagination and your visions. This is a great
opportunity to be yourself, without pressure to be something that you’re not. Try
not to compare yourself to other couples. Your relationship doesn’t have to look like
anyone else’s.
 Experiment with living in the present and accepting your partner as he or she is.
Your partner is incredibly complex—as all people are—and you may never rationally
understand everything about him or her. Don’t be afraid to spend some time in
ambiguity and not knowing.
 You may need to place a higher priority on practical matters than you’d like. Try
creating a system to assure that your life together runs smoothly on a practical level.
 Talk about the things that bother you. It’s too easy to step back and analyze a
situation rather just talking to your partner. While Analysts often have powerful
mental gifts, it’s unlikely that you’re a mind reader. Be careful about assumptions. If
necessary, think about communicating with your partner as “collecting data.”
Analysts – Diplomats
As you might recall, Diplomats have the Intuitive and Feeling traits. Thanks to their Intuitive
qualities, Diplomats and Analysts share a visionary, open-minded view of the world. Unlike
Sentinels and Explorers, they inhabit a world of ideas and abstractions. On a first date, this
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  86
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
common area may create a quick connection between an Analyst and a Diplomat. While
the Analyst may focus more on systems and rationality and the Diplomat on humanity and
values, they will both love talking about big ideas, and neither will have patience for small
talk. Both Analysts and Diplomats fill their mental landscapes with creative concepts and
dreams, so they will find endless subjects for conversation.
Analysts may feel that their cool rationality is balanced by the warmth and emotional
literacy that Diplomats bring to a relationship. Diplomats, on the other hand, may like
Analysts for their reasoned approach and their ability to work with ideas in a smart and
unique fashion. Both Analysts and Diplomats see sex as something that transcends
physical stimulation and release. They bring creativity, imagination, and meaning to the
bedroom, which can make for a powerful connection. Both groups are loyal to their
partners and, once they’ve found the right person, ready to commit fully and responsibly.
There is no such thing as a perfect pairing, however, and complications will always arise.
An Analyst–Diplomat couple may face obstacles due to their differing views on romantic
gestures and emotional expression. Analysts may find romantic overtures silly or
pointless, whereas Diplomats lead from the heart and deeply value such gestures. For
instance, Analysts may roll their eyes at buying a bouquet only to have it sit in a vase and
die. Diplomats, on the other hand, often view such things metaphorically, and they may
see the flowers as a meaningful symbol of appreciation.
If they’ve learned that others expect these behaviors, Analysts may engage in some of the
rituals of courtship begrudgingly or by rote. Diplomats will be disappointed, however, if
they intuit that their partners’ gestures of affection aren’t genuine or heartfelt. This
disconnect may not pose a problem once a couple has come to know and understand each
other, but it can derail the opening stages of a relationship, when two people are trying to
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  87
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
gauge each other’s interest. Given time, the Diplomat in a relationship will learn that the
Analyst’s affections can run deep even if they aren’t expressed outwardly. In turn, the
Analyst will come to appreciate how important meaningful gestures are to the Diplomat.
Organization can be another source of stress for Analysts who partner with Diplomats. An
Analyst–Diplomat couple should make conscious efforts to ensure that life’s more practical
matters are not left unattended. Deep, meaningful conversations can be immensely
rewarding, but sometimes it’s necessary to necessary to address bills, grocery shopping,
and domestic chores too.
Diplomats’ overall sensitivity and their concern for others’ feelings may seem excessive,
inefficient, or irrational to an Analyst partner. Issues may also arise in cases where the
Diplomat in a relationship wants to vent about a problem and the Analyst jumps to offer
solutions rather than sympathy or compassion.
Actively working to understand each another and appreciate these differences can smooth
over potential conflicts for Analyst–Diplomat couples. Learning and discussing each other’s
personality type can be a good conversation starter when it comes to these matters.
Tips for Analysts with Diplomats:
 Your Diplomat partner will often find meaning or significance in things that seem
trivial to you. For example, he or she might see romantic gestures as symbolic of
deeper sentiments, so resist your tendency to dismiss these gestures as pointless
or silly.
 When your partner brings a problem to you, he or she might want you to listen and
sympathize, not develop a battery of action plans. If you provide one of your
trademark rational solutions, you risk further upsetting your partner. Try asking
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  88
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
questions and listening instead. Don’t be afraid to ask if your partner would like
some suggestions before offering advice.
Tips for Diplomats with Analysts:
 Emotional expression can feel like another language for Analysts. If your partner
doesn’t open up emotionally or make romantic gestures, that doesn’t necessarily
signal a lack of interest.
 When you bring up your problems, your Analyst partner may play devil’s advocate
or leap in to offer solutions. Chances are that he or she doesn’t intend to be cold
and callous. You might prefer for your partner to offer support rather than action
plans, but his or her eagerness to propose a rational solution ultimately comes from
a place of care and concern.
Tips for Both
 Over time, it may become necessary for you to organize yourselves better. See if
you can come up with some kind of a system to manage practical matters, such as
bills and household chores.
 You may enjoy thinking about ideas and possibilities, but learn to spend some time
in the “here and now.” If you’re constantly rearranging the universe and living in the
future, you may find yourself exhausted and discontented. A dose of the present
moment can help you develop gratitude and appreciation for your lives together.

Analysts – Sentinels
Thanks to their Intuitive trait, Analysts love ideas, concepts, and complex systems. They
create visions for the future, and they strive to change and evolve throughout their lives.
Sentinels have the Observant trait, however, which means that elusive ideas and visions
seem impractical to them. They prefer to pay attention to reality, the present moment, and
the world in front of them. Sentinels make up their minds about how they’d like their life
to be, and if things change, they’ll likely cling to the way things were before.
Let’s consider how each type approaches dating. Once Analysts decide to find a partner,
they view dating as a serious task—difficult, but necessary. They may rationally consider
what they want and develop a list of qualifications for a potential partner. Sentinels also
rely on preconceptions when looking for a mate. Although they may not create a checklist,
they are deeply influenced by the traditions they know, the things they’ve experienced,
and societal expectations.
As a result, Analysts and Sentinels are likely to know exactly what they want in a partner—
unlike romantic Diplomats or adventurous Explorers. Online dating might be right up their
alleys.
Once they meet, Analysts might impress Sentinels with their serious natures, their
intelligence, and their intense work ethics. These traits may speak to Sentinels’ desire for
a stable life with a good spouse. On the other hand, Sentinels may appeal to Analysts
thanks to their organizational abilities, their attention to detail, and their regard for social
conventions and family—all areas where Analysts might feel inadequate. While Analysts
solve problems in the lofty reaches of conceptual thought, Sentinels can keep them
grounded by taking care of everyday concerns.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  90
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
This pairing can face issues as well. Analysts can come across as condescending or
superior, and this contempt can be especially hurtful for Sentinels, who put significant
effort into creating a stable home and relationship. And while Sentinels usually don’t ask
for praise, they enjoy being appreciated and may become passive aggressive when they
aren’t. Sentinels and Analysts are both loyal, so this disconnect may not derail the
relationship entirely. To enhance their connection, however, Analysts should remind
themselves to express gratitude for how much their Sentinel partners do for the
relationship.
When an Intuitive type enters into a relationship with an Observant type, they may clash
over practical matters. An Analyst may tolerate dirty dishes in a sink longer than a Sentinel,
for example. An Intuitive–Observant couple has to prevent these differences from
escalating into sources of conflict. For the Sentinel, forcing an Analyst partner to prioritize
day-to-day details will be a daunting if not impossible task. Choosing battles wisely and
taking a position of acceptance might help the Sentinel cope with this.
Lastly, Analysts can harm the relationship if they treat it as a system to improve. Sentinels
won’t understand this mindset, and they may even feel that it threatens the stability of
what they have worked so hard to build. If faced with criticism or cold rationality, a Sentinel
will likely become hurt and defensive. To avoid this situation, both partners should learn
about the other’s personality type and honor each other’s strengths, weaknesses, and
worldviews.
Tips for Analysts with Sentinels
 Show your appreciation. Let your partner know how much he or she has impacted
your life. If it helps, look at your life together as a system and take an inventory of
the wonderful things your Sentinel partner contributes. And then speak up.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  91
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
 Recognize your differences. While you are all about change and innovation, your
partner values stability and tradition. Introducing a “better system” to your
relationship can create anxiety for your Sentinel partner.
Tips for Sentinels with Analysts
 Practice acceptance and choose your battles carefully. Your partner may not pay
attention to details the way you do. He or she may even forget birthdays and
anniversaries. Chances are you won’t be able to change this.
 Don’t panic if your partner suggests changes to the relationship. Analysts love
fiddling with systems, so your partner’s eagerness to improve things doesn’t mean
he or she is dissatisfied. Try to discuss your partner’s suggestions in a non-defensive
manner.
Tips for Both
 Don’t try to change your partner. Enjoy your commonalities and accept your
differences.
 Find ways to combine your unique strengths through shared activities. The two of
you have diverse skill sets that, when joined together, can make life more fulfilling
and enjoyable. Travelling is one obvious example, with the Analyst charting out the
itinerary and the Sentinel handling important details.
Analysts – Explorers
As we mentioned in the section above, Intuitive and Observant types have some important
differences. While Analysts trade in ideas, concepts, and visions for the future, Explorers
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  92
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
live fully in the present. Explorers seek out the new and exciting, and they are curious
about everything—except long-winded discussions about abstractions and ideas, that is.
Explorers love specific challenges, such as mastering a musical instrument or a craft. Both
Analysts and Explorers enjoy solving things, but Analysts tackle theoretical puzzles while
Explorers cut their teeth on real and immediate problems.
So what happens when an Explorer and an Analyst meet for a date? When Analysts connect
their theories and ideas to practical concerns, they can impress Explorers. For example, an
Analyst who talks about computer code might appeal to an Explorer’s appreciation of tools
and devices. If the Analyst goes on too long, however, or veers away from practical matters,
he or she risks boring the Explorer.
Analysts may be attracted to aspects of the Explorer personality, such as spontaneity or
practicality, and they will likely appreciate Explorers who have mastered a craft. As a
counterbalance to their own serious nature, Analysts can benefit from the Explorer’s
looser, fun-loving attitude. If an Explorer is highly spontaneous or capricious, though, an
Analyst might see him or her as frivolous.
In a committed relationship, Analysts and Explorers will appreciate each other’s disregard
for social convention. There will be significantly less pressure in this area than there would
be if either of these types partnered with a Diplomat or a Sentinel. Analysts and Explorers
will also appreciate the space and freedom they grant each other. When in the middle of
a project, Analysts may seem almost entirely detached from their home lives. This could
work out quite well for Explorers, giving them ample time to discover their world in their
particular way. Nobody will ever accuse an Analyst–Explorer couple of smothering each
other.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  93
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
While Explorers are not highly sensitive to others’ opinions, Analysts should take care not
to come across as condescending. Otherwise, Analysts might convey to Explorers—directly
or indirectly—that their work or contributions aren’t especially deep or important.
Superiority and condescension can cause a lot of hurt in a relationship, and Analysts need
to take care of their partners’ feelings.
Explorers, on the other hand, may become impatient with the Analysts’ insatiable love of
knowledge and theories. While Analysts may seem immune to criticism, the truth is they
often feel quite deeply, so Explorers should take care not to dismiss their partners as
stodgy or boring. Rather than becoming irritated by their partners’ cerebral approach to
life, Explorers should occasionally encourage Analyst partners to come along on an
adventure.
Finally, Analysts tend to ignore the practical, mundane details of everyday life. This may
leave Explorers to deal with household chores and bills in their somewhat casual fashion.
While it may sound like a small issue, things like this can cause stress or conflict when
clothes are piled high in the middle of the bedroom floor. An Analyst–Explorer couple may
need to decide things like who does the laundry early on in the relationship, before such
things become a source of tension.
Tips for Analysts with Explorers
 Be careful with your partner’s feelings. Deliberately express some appreciation for
who they are and what they do. A little praise can go a long way with an Explorer.
 Find ways to de-stress through shared activities. As an Analyst, you probably
overthink things, ruminating on the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Romantic Relationships  94
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Your artistic and action-oriented Explorer partner can help you to relax, live in the
moment, and see the brighter side of life.
Tips for Explorers with Analysts
 Invite your partner to try new experiences with you—perhaps a new restaurant or
a cultural event. In addition to giving you quality time together, these activities can
also balance your Analyst’s very cerebral life.
 Remember that your partner doesn’t share your love of the present moment. Your
constant search for novelty may exhaust your Analyst partner or come across as
flaky. From your partner’s perspective, actions should make logical sense, and the
thrill of adrenaline won’t always be sufficient grounds for trying something new.
Tips for Both
 Discuss and divide household duties early in a committed relationship. Consider
hiring some outside help to handle such chores.
 Take some time to understand each other’s personality types. Suspend judgment
and remember that both of your approaches to life are equally legitimate and
useful. Learn to appreciate your differences and to enjoy the good things your
partner brings to the relationship. And most importantly, don’t try to change your
partner.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Friendships  95
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Friendships
People with the Architect personality type have more success in developing friendships
than romantic relationships, but their preference for rationality over emotional openness
can still hold them back. This intellectual distance extends in both directions: it makes
Architects notoriously difficult to get to know, and it also leads Architects to not bother
reading anyone they think isn’t on their level. Overcoming these hurdles is difficult,
especially when Architects meet people who don’t share their Intuitive trait.
In friendships as in other areas of their lives, Architects have strong opinions about what
works, what doesn’t, what they’re looking for, and what they’re not. These discriminating
tastes can come across as arrogant, but Architects would simply argue that their filtering
mechanism keeps them from wasting time and attention. In friendship, Architects want an
intellectual soul mate, and they’ll be bored by anyone who isn’t prepared for that kind of
relationship. Architects need to share ideas, so small talk, superficial friendliness, or gossip
won’t satisfy them socially.
Architects want a few deep, quality friendships rather than the social validation that comes
from a large circle of acquaintances. Because they value self-sufficiency and
independence, Architects need relatively little attention even from their close friends, and
they’ll likely expect their friendships to stay on good terms without a great deal of
maintenance.
Architects encourage their friends’ intellectual growth and help them understand complex
of difficult situations, but when it comes to emotional support, Architects are out of their
element. They shield their own emotions with rationality and logic, and they expect their
friends to do the same. When emotionally charged situations arise, Architects may have
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Friendships  96
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
no clue how to handle them appropriately—in stark contrast with their usual composure
and competence.
When Architects are among people they know and respect, however, they can relax and
enjoy themselves. For those who can keep up, Architects offer fantastic storytelling and
conversation. Their sarcasm and dark humor are not for the faint of heart, nor for those
who struggle to read between the lines. Observant types prefer straightforward
communication, so Architects will likely find themselves allied with Diplomats and fellow
Analysts instead.
It’s not easy to become close with an Architect. They may disregard traditional rules of
social conduct, but Architects have exacting expectations for others’ intellects, and they
expect their friends to share their uncompromising honesty and their desire to grow as an
individual. Architects tend to dismiss anyone who falls short of their standards, but when
they do find someone who meets their expectations, they can form a powerful and
stimulating friendship that will stand the test of time.
This doesn’t mean that Architects can’t forge friendships with different types. After all, if
there’s one thing Architects appreciate, it’s weighing different ideas and perspectives.
Architects can’t help but be intrigued by anyone who sheds new light on their assumptions
and forces them to think about things from different angles.
Being somewhat unusual, Architects may have been teased or bullied in childhood, and
these memories might predispose them against certain other personality types. They’d do
well to let go over old hurts, however, and approach new relationships and connections
with an open mind.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Friendships  97
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
But can reserved and stoical Architects function in a world of people who are—for the most
part—different from them? Can they relate to someone who gushes emotions and
excitement, or who likes adrenaline and horseplay, or who adheres to traditional
perspectives and beliefs?
The answer, of course, is yes.
Architects will benefit from consciously exposing themselves to other personality types.
Although Architects are known for their keen and unconventional ideas, their creativity can
stagnate if they surround themselves only with like-minded individuals. By engaging with
people who are different—for instance, people who struggle to accept criticism, or people
who enjoy opening up emotionally—Architects can develop an open mind, entertain new
perspectives, and better understand their own strengths and weaknesses.
Analyst Friends
Other Analysts are a natural fit for Architects, sharing a passion for new ideas, riddles, and
unconventional thought. This friendship will be defined by intellectual engagement rather
than social or emotional support, which is just how Architects they like it. Architects are
rare, as are Analysts in general, so they may have grown accustomed to feeling like they
don’t belong. In this light, encountering another Analyst is an invigorating breath of fresh
air.
That fresh air comes in handy, because these friends rarely run out of things to discuss.
From the time they wake up to the moment they fall asleep, Architects’ minds buzz with
analyses, and few others are likely to be able to keep pace. Analysts love bouncing ideas
back and forth, and Architects’ intellectual prowess will enable them to dissect their
friends’ ideas piece by piece—an oddly enjoyable process. In this friendship, there may be
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Friendships  98
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
a spirit of competition, with each friend challenging the other to establish a stronger
foundation for his or her thoughts.
Discussions between an Architect and another Analyst are unlikely to revolve around
people, feelings, social status, or immediate plans. Instead, they’ll gravitate toward esoteric
topics and systems, strategies, or analyses. Having an Analyst friend lets Architects be
themselves and pursue their interests and curiosity with little or no inhibition.
Problems can arise in these friendships, however. Architects have little tolerance for
ineffectiveness, and their tendency to see broken systems everywhere creates a strong
pull towards action. Some other Analyst types—Debaters and Logicians, for example—
might discuss solutions without taking action, which can lead an Architect to become
frustrated or judgmental. To correct this imbalance, Architects should try to be more
relaxed about their ideas, and their friends should make an effort to take action whenever
appropriate.
When emotionally charged situations do occur—not only issues within the friendship, but
also major life events or challenges—Architects generally don’t want profuse apologies,
pity, or hugs. In these situations, they’ll appreciate a matter-of-fact Analyst friend who
helps them rationalize the situation, or simply leaves them alone about it.
An Architect and a fellow Analyst can avoid burnout from their constant debates by
becoming both more flexible and more encouraging toward each other. To prevent
friction, they should also remember that they might differ in how much they desire to take
action on their ideas. Under the right conditions, however, these two types can have a
tremendously stimulating and productive friendship.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Friendships  99
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Diplomat Friends
Architect–Diplomat friendships may begin with an instant connection, thanks to a shared
Intuitive trait. Unlike with Analysts, however, this connection is fueled by a mysterious,
intangible attraction rather than obvious similarities. Architects and Diplomats recognize
in each other the ability to see beyond the superficial and go deep. Diplomats tend to
understand the world in terms of human or spiritual interactions, whereas Analysts look
for rational systems. This difference is unlikely to derail the connection, however. These
friends will be fascinated to encounter a new perspective as insightful as their own—
something not always easy to find.
Like Analysts, Diplomats are full of fresh ideas. Architects think of what would work best in
terms of dispassionate efficiency, but Diplomats think of ways to bring people together
and strive for the common good. If these friends use their strengths in tandem, applying
rational ideas to high ideals, they can be a force to be reckoned with, especially in the
workplace—as long as they can avoid stepping on each other’s toes.
Architects think of emotions as irrational wrenches in their clockwork. This mindset can
seem cynical or even offensive to idealistic, empathic Diplomats. Architects have little
desire to lower their shields and express their feelings, something Diplomats crave. On the
other hand, Diplomats’ idealism may strike Architects as unrealistic or even inauthentic.
Although both role groups try to avoid open conflict, they believe strongly in their ideas—
especially types like Advocates and Protagonists. If an Architect alienates a Diplomat—by
delivering especially cutting criticisms, for example, or acting from unclear motivations—
neither party may be willing to repair the rift. That said, most conflicts can be avoided if
these friends maintain a heightened perspective, which happens to be their specialty.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Friendships  100
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Ultimately, Architects and Diplomats want the same thing: a world that functions better.
Diplomats, especially Protagonists and Campaigners, help their friends recognize the
importance of emotional and social health and expression. Architects help their friends
develop their analytical abilities, placing that raw compassion, idealism, and leadership
into a system for achieving a tangible good. This friendship is likely to flourish for many
years, enduring both distance and time.
Sentinel Friends
Under the right circumstances, Architects and Sentinels can complement each other well
as friends. Architects excel at big-picture thinking, and Sentinels can offer them practical
support and remind them to see the little steps through. That said, an Architect’s friendship
with a Sentinel won’t benefit from the instant connection that two Intuitive people enjoy,
so it can take time for these two types to develop a rapport. A friendship between an
Architect and a Sentinel will likely emerge due to circumstance rather than design—if
they’re coworkers, for example, or if they share mutual friends.
Over time, Architects and Sentinels can gain an appreciation for their mutual differences.
For example, Architects struggle with teamwork and cooperation, often writing people off
for making some logical transgression or other. Sentinels, on the other hand, stand by
projects and people with grit and determination, seeing them through no matter what.
Architects are often impressed by—or even envious of—the energy and focus that
Sentinels can maintain from moment to moment, day to day, even year to year. This
steadfast strength of character is rare, and Architects respect it. On their part, Sentinels
appreciate Architects’ foresight, and their ability to align their ideas with an actual course
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Friendships  101
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
of action. Executives and Logisticians especially are results-driven, and they’ll likely
appreciate their Architect friends’ consistent visions and plans.
Architects can learn even more from people-oriented Sentinels, such as Defenders and
Consuls. If there’s one flaw Architects are famous for, it’s their cold efficiency with respect
to social maintenance. Sentinels, on the other hand, preserve relationships by following
through and sustaining steady contact and activity. Sentinel friends can inspire Architects
to actively maintain their relationships rather than letting them lie fallow—and potentially
deteriorate.
An Architect–Sentinel friendship can face some significant challenges. Sentinels value
practicality, and they can see Architects as bafflingly out of touch with the everyday.
Architects may not be flexible enough to understand let alone embrace Sentinels’ need
and respect for social mores and expectations. This disconnect reveals how friendships
that look good on paper—between people who match on up to four traits—can
nevertheless break down. The way those traits are expressed, it turns out, can be
incompatible.
If a Sentinel and an Architect appreciate each other’s differences and play off each other’s
strengths, though, they can share a rewarding friendship, with the Sentinel keeping the
Architect grounded and the Architect offering a healthy stream of ideas so they always
have something to do together.
Explorer Friends
The Architect–Explorer friendship isn’t an instant fit. Explorers inhabit the present moment
and live for its pleasures. Known for their unpredictability, Explorers can seem recklessly
shortsighted to Architects.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Friendships  102

But it’s not all bad. Architects struggle to simply have fun and be excited about something,
and Explorer friends can teach them to approach the world with enthusiasm and childlike
curiosity. On the other hand, Architects can remind Explorers to consider the
consequences of their actions. Setting sail is a grand adventure, but you need someone
beside you who knows how to read the stars.
This is the real beauty of the Architect–Explorer friendship: Architects have so many ideas
about what’s possible, and a spontaneous Explorer can prompt them to try new things and
take action without over-planning or becoming lost in theory. If they can handle their
differences and meet each other halfway, these friends can accomplish many adventures.
Architects appreciate an outlook that is different from their own but still gets results.
Interactions with Virtuosos, who are relatively technical, can be a great deal of fun, with
the two friends working together to devise and build systems and machines. But more
expressive or sensitive Explorers, especially Entertainers and Adventurers, won’t have the
same appeal for an Architect. Friendships between Architects and Entertainers are
especially unlikely. Entertainers live for excitement, pleasure, aesthetics, fashion, and
sensory delight. They get caught up in the drama of the moment and then move on before
the dust settles. This behavior will baffle an Architect, and the Entertainers will have no
interest in offering a rational explanation, leading both parties to become exasperated.

Parenthood  103

Parenthood
Parenting, like so many other relationships, is a challenge for Architects. Being so heavily
invested in rational thought and logic, Architects are often unprepared for dealing with
someone who hasn’t developed these abilities, and it’s not as if they can simply walk away
from their children. Fortunately, Architects are uniquely capable of committing to a long-
term project, especially one as meaningful as parenthood, with all the intellectual vigor
they can muster.
First and foremost, Architect parents may never be able to deliver the warmth and
coddling that stereotypes say they should. Architects are rational, perfectionistic, often
insensitive, and certainly not prone to overt displays of physical affection. It takes a clear
and conscious effort on their part to curb and adapt these qualities to their children’s
needs, especially in the younger years. If they have an especially sensitive child, Architects
risk inadvertently trampling those sensitivities or coming across as cold and uncaring.
Even less sensitive children need emotional support, but Architects struggle enough at
managing their own feelings in healthy ways, let alone the feelings of others. Architects
encourage their children to avoid “unproductive” emotional outbursts in favor of a
solutions-based approach to resolving issues. That said, Architect parents don’t tell their
children what to do. Instead, they lead their children to use their own minds and arrive at
their own conclusions.
Architects aren’t “helicopter parents” who hover over their children at all times. They
recognize that life is often the best teacher, and they tend to be fairly liberal. Architects
allow their children to have their own adventures and develop their critical thinking skills
by making their own decisions. This isn’t to say that Architects parents are lenient—far
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Parenthood  104
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
from it. They expect their children to use their freedom responsibly. The weight of this
expectation alone is often enough to convey the ground rules, without the Architect ever
having to voice them. When necessary, however, Architect parents speak openly and
honestly with their children. To them, knowing the truth is better than not knowing, or
worse yet, being wrong.
If their children are receptive to this approach, Architect parents find themselves respected
and trusted. Architects are excellent communicators when they want to be, capable of
framing problems as opportunities for personal growth. They help their children to
establish their own brand of rational thinking and independent problem-solving skills, to
be applied to more and more complex situations as they mature. Architects’ ultimate goal
as parents is to ensure that their children are prepared to deal with whatever life throws
their way.
In certain cases, however, Architect parents must learn to adapt to a more sensitive
approach—and quickly. It isn’t necessarily healthy to disregard emotions. After all,
suppressing emotions doesn’t eliminate them; instead, it causes them to reemerge,
unaddressed and untamed. Architect parents should try to honor their children’s
emotions—even those that seem irrational—as well as their own.
It may help to remember that emotions have a neurochemical basis, as do all of our
thoughts. Also, even though expressing feelings is difficult for Architects, emotional literacy
can fit into their overarching philosophy of intelligent self-direction. By encouraging their
children to deal with feelings responsibly and honestly, Architects can advance their
ultimate mission: to help their children grow into capable, self-sufficient adults. Architects
understand that this growth can’t happen if they shield their children from every source of
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Parenthood  105

ill and harm, but they believe that if they give their children the right tools, they won’t have
to.
Parenting isn’t so simple that it can be summed up in a few paragraphs. There’s no such
thing as a default or typical child as far as personality is concerned. Each child is a unique,
evolving individual, with his or her own wants and needs. Each child requires an
individualized approach.
By the time they become parents, Architects have had years to sort out what works for
them. They prize self-determination and intelligent action above just about all else. They
value (or require) clarity and emotional stability in others. They believe that the most
efficient solution is the right one, and they have trouble withholding their opinions on how
things should be done—even when their children are full-grown adults.
If they end up with a child who is also in the Analyst role group, Architects have a head
start in sharing their values with their children. But what happens when their children are
from other type groups? What if their children don’t enjoy intellectual puzzles, books,
grand strategy, or science? What if their children are impulsive and strongly emotional,
behaving in ways that seem utterly irrational (but are in fact perfectly natural)?
Through awareness and effort, Architects can strengthen their less-developed sides and
connect with children who are different from them—children who shut down in the face
of criticism, for example, or who actually want and crave clearly defined expectations. The
discussion below can also help Architect parents to develop more meaningful
relationships with those children who share their own traits and qualities.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Parenthood  106
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Analyst Children
It’s easy to see the upside of an Architects’ having an Analyst child. Because they share the
Intuitive trait, the parent and child will take in—or rather infer and create—information in
much the same way. Because they share the Thinking trait, they also make decisions based
on that information in much the same way. This makes communication between Architect
parents and their Analyst children relatively straightforward.
It also means that they enjoy many of the same activities, such as games and puzzles.
Architects’ actions are planned and cerebral, not impulsive, social, or physical, so it can be
quite a relief to know that their children would rather plan a morning hike or head to the
library than roughhouse or host a pumpkin-carving party. Commander and Debater
children challenge their parents’ social awkwardness, but at least they’ll be drawn to the
same activities and interests.
As in any relationship between similar people, there can be drawbacks. Without exposure
to differing perspectives, neither parent nor child is forced to become better rounded as
an individual. Architects value personal growth, but only in areas they prioritize:
intelligence, rationality, and efficiency. Emotional expression, socialization, and day-to-day
practicality all suffer. An Architect parent will find it easy to explain why we tell the truth,
but he or she may falter when it comes to explaining why we brush our hair, how to tie a
shoelace, or how to get on with other people.
Social and practical lessons aside, mental and emotional health is the most vital
consideration in this relationship. Analyst children struggle to understand their own
emotional needs, and Architects have poorly developed tools for healthy emotional
expression. If Architects’ children grow up emotionally stunted, the best-case scenario is
that they just don’t know how to relax and have fun. The worst-case scenario is that they
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Parenthood  107
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
grow up to be cold, ruthless individuals who dominate those around them, as an unhealthy
version of Commanders can sometimes be.
Sometimes it makes sense to do what’s efficient rather than what’s fun, or to do what’s
necessary even if it hurts someone’s feelings. But when these behaviors become an
ingrained, unquestioned habit, they breed unhappiness and dissatisfaction in ways that
can ruin relationships. It’s important for Architect parents to realize the importance of their
own emotional needs, and to ensure that their children, no matter how stoic or logical they
appear to be, realize theirs.
Diplomat Children
Architects with Diplomat children will have some of the same advantages and challenges
as Architects with Analyst children. After all, Architects and Diplomats share many traits.
Both are inspired by imagination and the intricate connections between ideas and people.
They both enjoy creative games and long discussions about what they can do with the
connections they see, but they can be clumsy and forgetful when it comes to practical
matters. They also share an innate understanding of moral principles. Architect parents
need to explain the value of honesty, integrity, and fairness only once for the message to
hit home with their Diplomat children.
There are disconnects as well, however. Architects can be harsh in the clarity and
directness of their communication, which can wound their Diplomat children. Diplomats
are sensitive and imaginative, with a tendency to read into things and extrapolate. When
they receive criticism from a loved one—particularly from a parent—it can be a staggering
blow. Especially with more Turbulent children, a single careless or critical remark can
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Parenthood  108
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
create a real sense of failure—not only in the area that’s being discussed, but also as a
person.
With Diplomat children, Architect parents must take exceptional care, especially when
delivering criticism, to also express their love. Suppose an Architect father expresses
disappointment that his son lied. To the Architect, this is a statement of fact, and it reflects
a logical assessment of what is right and wrong. For a Diplomat child, however, this
criticism can create a deep wound or even create a rift in the connection he feels with his
father.
Even in delivering benign advice, Architects should remember that not every problem
demands a solution or a rationalization. When his or her child goes through a breakup, an
Architect might be tempted to explain how irrelevant the relationship was in the scheme
of things, or observe that the son or daughter now has extra time to do other things.
Sometimes, Diplomat children need warmth, compassion, and encouragement to feel
their emotions—not an action plan.
Fortunately, Architects who’ve made some effort at self-awareness can tell when they’ve
stepped on their children’s toes, and they know how to change tactics to smooth the
situation. Diplomats—even those with the Judging trait—grow into tolerant and
understanding individuals who will recognize and value their parents’ efforts. In this
relationship, both parent and child will have a powerful desire to learn and improve, and
both will have much to teach each other. As a result, a relationship between an Architect
parent and Diplomat child is among the most rewarding.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Parenthood  109

Sentinel Children
Architects expect their children to mature into intelligent, independent, successful adults,
and Sentinels strive to live up to the standards of their role models, especially their
parents. Sentinel children therefore face a paradox: They want to grow into the self-
sufficient model that their Architect parents outline for them, but they’re motivated to do
so by obedience and respect.
In the early years, this model works splendidly. Architects suggest stimulating activities,
like reading and puzzles, and their Sentinel children, especially Logisticians and Defenders,
are grateful for the suggestion and for the opportunity to please their parents. As time
passes, Architects push their sons and daughters to govern themselves, but Sentinel
children will continue to look to them for guidance and support.
Sentinels, especially Defenders, often fill this gap by pursuing activities they think their
parents respect, rather than what they enjoy themselves. Whether they’re enrolling in
clubs or choosing majors in college, they’ll wonder: “What will Mom and Dad think?” This
dynamic is problematic, because Architects’ favorite activities are often Sentinels’
weaknesses, and not doing well in these areas harms the self-esteem of Sentinel children.
As a result, it’s important for Architect parents to take the time to really understand what
their children want—and encourage it. Architects are perfectly capable of this, but the
activities that Sentinels enjoy—especially Executives and Consuls—correspond to
Architects’ weaknesses. Keeping up with their Sentinel children’s numerous friends, clubs,
and groups can be daunting for private, focused Architects.
Sentinels need day-to-day reliability, social hierarchy, and steady authority, so
independence-loving Architects have their work cut out for them. Fortunately, Architects
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Parenthood  110
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
value self-improvement and can recognize and appreciate their children’s unique
strengths. Architects often come to genuinely respect their Sentinel children’s steadfast
character, willingness to rise to the occasion, and ability to organize and coordinate things
and people.
Explorer Children
If there’s one thing Architects enjoy, it’s transforming an inefficient process into something
lean, clean, and effective. Fortunately, Explorers share this passion, though their approach
is far more tangible. Even at a young age, Explorers strive for mastery and personal skill:
Virtuosos and Entrepreneurs are drawn to tools and activities, whereas Adventurers and
Entertainers are fascinated by beauty and human connection.
Architects enjoy organizing new things and ideas for their young children to explore, and
they love helping their children develop skills in their areas of interest. It usually doesn’t
take long to identify Explorers’ passions. When something strikes a chord, they can hardly
be pulled away.
Explorers appreciate independence, and as they get older, they don’t need their parents
to keep offering up ways to stave off boredom. This, of course, suits Architects just fine.
Explorers are creative individuals, and if they need guidance or suggestions from their
parents, it’s to help keep their energy pointed in a useful direction—or at least in a direction
that spares the walls another impromptu expressionist mural.
Because they’re so spontaneous and their interests are so fleeting, Explorers can tax
Architects’ patience. An Explorer’s “I want it now” attitude can frustrate an Architect parent,
who values mental focus and seeing things through from start to finish. Explorers can be
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Parenthood  111

sensitive—especially Adventurers and Entertainers—so if their demands meet a hard line
of criticism from their parents, the relationship will suffer.
Explorers’ sensitivity to criticism and impulsivity are by far the biggest frustrations for their
Architect parents. Architect parents want their children to build a framework for future
success, and they worry that their Explorers will be too self-indulgent to do so. That said,
Architect parents should remember that Explorers can achieve success and fulfillment by
honoring and pursing their passions. Through steady support and long-term advice,
Architects can offer just enough guidance keep their Explorer children out of trouble—
without stifling their creativity or preventing them from leaving their own unique mark on
the world.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Academic Path  112
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Academic Path
Some people spend nearly a third of their lives in school. Others choose to enter the
workforce earlier and don’t spend as much time in classes or libraries. Either way, most
people spend many of their important formative years in school. No matter how long you
remain in the academic world, your time there is important. These years can not only set
you on a specific career path, but also affect your self-esteem and psyche well into the
future—for better or for worse.
Architects are among the rarest personality types, and so other people won’t always
understand their sometimes bookish and standoffish ways. This can create difficulties in
school. By understanding the challenges they face in the academic world, however,
Architects can make the best use of their time and experience.
How Architects Learn
Architects are intuitive thinkers. They absorb information easily, and then their powerful
intuition combines relevant details into a rich tapestry of new ideas. This subconscious
process doesn’t require much deliberate thought, effort, or design. Most Architects report
that it “just happens.”
A loose analogy for the way Architects learn is Georges Seurat’s technique as an artist. This
19th-century French painter used a technique called pointillism, in which he painstakingly
applied tiny dots of paint to a canvas. If you study one of his most famous paintings under
a microscope, you’ll see only a mass of meaningless dots. But when you stand back and
view it as a whole, your brain assembles the thousands of dots into the image of a French
park, filled with human activity, landscape, and emotion. Each dot is essential to the
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Academic Path  113

painting, but the painting’s meaning is only apparent when you consider the work as a
whole. In a similar fashion, Architects can absorb many facts and pieces of information
and synthesize them into a bigger-picture perspective.
Architects process the details they learn through their strong imagination, which enables
them to discover connections and grasp meaning. They then filter each insight, making
sure that evidence and logic support their conclusions. If so, Architects accept this as
“something learned,” and the conclusion is something they feel comfortable presenting.
It’s difficult to capture with words how quickly and organically this process occurs, but that
is essentially how it works. A popular culture example of this style of thinking might be
Sherlock Holmes’s methods from the modern BBC series.
For Architects to reach their full learning potential, they must be free to run around in their
mental playgrounds. Their imaginations and creativity need room to explore, and it will be
counterproductive if a teacher or parent tries to pin them down or restrict the way they
organize their thoughts. A curriculum that is too tight or focused will make Architects
uncomfortable, and it may event lead them to disengage from the lesson and go through
the motions to get through it as quickly as possible. From a teacher’s perspective, this
might not seem to pose an issue, but it’s wasted time for the student.
Architects love a puzzle that needs solving—whether practical or theoretical. As Analysts,
they see the world as a big chessboard, and their goal is to become chess masters.
Architects like to plan, and they prefer to go into a lesson with a clear idea of where it will
take them. Like most Intuitive and Judging types, Architects are most comfortable when
they have plenty of time to deliberate before answering a complex problem. This isn’t
because they are slow, but because they are thorough. To return to the chess analogy,
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Academic Path  114
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Architects like to take their time hunched over the board, sorting out their next move and
anticipating future changes.
High School
In the classroom: Architect personality types find high achievement more intrinsically
rewarding than any other personality type. Other people might work hard in hopes of
praise or recognition, but Architects set high intellectual standards to please themselves
alone. Architects, especially Turbulent ones, are perfectionists, and they will do whatever
it takes to satisfy their high expectations for themselves. They dedicate great amounts of
time and effort to solving complex problems or unraveling mysteries. The Rubik’s Cube
must have been designed for this personality type. High IQs are common in this group,
and earning good grades comes naturally to Architects—although they may not apply
themselves if they don’t see the point of a given curriculum. Generally speaking, however,
their curiosity, intelligence, and work ethic put them well above the ordinary student when
it comes to the energy they apply to studying.
At the high school stage of their development, Architects have newly acquired the skill of
conceptualization—or seeing beyond the concrete. Like a new toy, abstract thought feels
invigorating to young Architects as they begin to enjoy a fuller experience within their
visionary selves. Combine this development with the growth of their knowledge and
intelligence, and they blossom into formidable students.
When they choose their courses, Architects are drawn to science, technology, and the arts.
These subjects allow them to shine as experts and challenge them to seek new solutions.
Political science and economics may prove interesting for similar reasons. Because
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Academic Path  115
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Architects tend to do well in any course they take, their high grades in other subjects may
not correspond to their level of interest.
Despite Architects’ academic strengths, their high school years are not without certain
challenges. During this timeframe, social problems may bother Architects and disrupt their
learning. Architects’ reclusive behavior, combined with their academic skill, might cause
their peers to label them as “nerds” and “geeks.” This may result in bullying, which can be
a significant distraction in the classroom. Architects can usually ignore others’ opinions,
but bullying—which is active and personal—can be very troublesome. Architects may
unwittingly exacerbate the problem by showing impatience with their classmates, who
generally take longer to learn what Architects see as elementary.
When they see how easily good grades come to them, Architects may not work hard at
certain subjects—especially those that don’t excite them. Architects tend to disregard
conventional rules, structures, and mores, so they won’t necessarily worry about being
“lazy” or not attending to their work. For them, the bigger picture takes priority, so they
won’t value facts, subjects, or lessons that don’t apply toward their larger goals.
Architects will succeed at most subjects, regardless of whether they put in time and energy.
That said, they may ignore valuable lessons and details that aren’t of interest to them, and
they may fail to pick up an important life skill: how to be disciplined even when you don’t
feel like it.
Outside the classroom: If you’ve been to high school, you know there’s more to it than
just classes. And there can be as many lessons in a school’s corridors and parking lots as
there are in the classroom. So let’s take a moment to consider high school as a place where
some important social lessons unfold.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Academic Path  116
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Architects are rare, and their uniqueness may not be appreciated in high school, a time
when “not being weird” is a social priority. As mentioned above, bullying in school can be
a problem for Architects. Combine this with their lack of interest in popularity or social
convention, and you have the makings of an outsider. Being an outsider in high school can
be difficult, even if that role is self-imposed. More than likely, Architects can be found
hanging out alone or with a small group of people who are similar to themselves. This
isolation can feed unpleasant and unfair stereotypes.
Architects feel most comfortable in academic, scientific, or technical extracurricular
groups. It may take some encouragement to get them to join any organization at all, but it
will be easier if the topic is right, such as clubs that involve robotics or rocketry. Any group
that highlights skills and intelligence draws Architects. Chess Club, Art Club, Latin Club,
Debate Team, Model UN—anything that challenges Architects and presents an interesting
mental exercise is something they might join.
Architects occasionally take leadership roles in extracurricular groups, but only when their
expertise and problem-solving skills are required. They often wait to step in until it’s clear
that those in charge are in over their heads. While Architects aren’t comfortable in the
limelight, their need to solve problems can supersede their hesitation to step forward and
take charge.
Work or College?
While many factors can influence whether someone should go college, personality type
plays a role in the equation. Not long ago, most people thought of college or university as
the quickest path to success and security. Now some of these same people are vigorously
arguing against higher education for everyone, having seen college dropouts succeed on
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Academic Path  117
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
a grand scale in our technological age. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are two of the most famous
examples. In any case, college is just one potential path to discovering one’s niche.
So what should Architects consider when thinking about college?
Will a degree be necessary for the work I want to do?
Depending on their interests, Architects may need to earn credentials in the form of a
license or a degree to pursue certain career directions. Becoming a scientist, economist,
political scientist, lawyer, professor, or academic researcher obviously requires some
training. The most attractive careers for Architects often need a diploma.
Will I be able to gain something intangible and yet valuable from going to college?
For many people, there is more to higher education than enhancing your employability.
College is a life passage, a growth opportunity, and a chance to take steps toward
becoming an independent young adult. There is ample opportunity at college to explore
the systems, theories, and models that Architects are so fond of. College can offer time,
space, and guidance to help young Analysts discover their places in the world.
In College
Architects who go to college or university feel at home almost immediately—academically,
if not socially. No matter what high school was like, Architects have a real opportunity to
shine when they go to college. The right college will allow an Architect to freely exercise his
or her powerful and creative intellect. At college, Architects are likelier than they were in
high school to find kindred spirits in the classroom or in study groups. This can be
dismaying, however, and it can even create resentment or competition. Suddenly,
Architects may not be the only Analysts in the pond, nor the smartest kids in class.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Academic Path  118
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
College is a time for Architects to leverage their strengths and talents in a real way. Subjects
that might attract Architects include science (any kind), technology (any kind), economics,
political science, law, business analysis, education, and anthropology, to name a few.
Architects tend to do well in anything they try, but they’ll be most fulfilled by a major that
requires them to interpret and synthesize a tangled, complex web of facts and data.
Some people design their college experiences with the goal of making a good living
afterward—a goal Architects may adopt. Many of the preferred majors listed above could
easily lead to well-paying jobs. That said, Architects usually pursue college with the aim of
becoming better problem solvers in their field. It just happens that their talents are rare
and valuable enough to warrant large incomes in the years after graduation.
One area of difficulty for Architects is those courses nobody wants to go to: the
foundational prerequisites. Most Architects test out of these, but at one point or another,
every Architect student will encounter coursework that seems elementary or pointless.
Architects may well be tempted to ignore or dismiss these classes, but less-than-thrilling
coursework can actually offer good disciplinary practice for Architects and other Analysts.
After all, life after college will often entail tasks that seem meaningless or boring—but are
nevertheless necessary. For self-aware Architects, college can be an opportunity to build
discipline and prepare for the adult world.
Like most young people, Architects delight in the autonomy offered by going away to
college. For most students, this is the first significant taste of life away from their families
and their families’ rules. It’s no different for Architects, who often look to college as an
opportunity to come into their own or escape any bullying or teasing they experienced in
high school. Architects’ slightly awkward or disinterested social style will follow them to
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Academic Path  119
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
college, and “party life” will hold little sway for them. Rather than maximizing their social
lives, Architects will spend time on their own or with a small group of friends.
If stress from their hard work and perfectionism becomes overwhelming, however,
Architects may make an excursion into party life. Architects, especially Turbulent ones, can
be hard on themselves, setting high expectations and pushing themselves too hard. Under
these circumstances, they may react by indulging in parties, alcohol, drugs, or casual sex.
Over time, however, Architects’ preferences for control, rationality, and clear goals should
take over. More likely than not, partying will be no more than a short-lived phase for
Architects.
For the typical Architect, university life represents a step toward becoming an expert or
professional in the field they’d like to pursue. As they advance on their path through higher
education, they will feel more and more as if they are coming into their own. And while
Architects may never be social gadflies, those around them will begin to appreciate their
abilities and, by extension, the Architects themselves.
“The Architect” (INTJ)

Career and Professional Development
Architect personalities are known for their ability to digest difficult, complex principles and
convert them into clear and actionable ideas. Architects are excellent strategists, and their
imagination and confidence allow them to devise and implement challenging long-term
plans without many problems. In the right career path, these skills can be tremendously
valuable. Architects excel at jobs that involve planning, strategy, and theoretical rigor. You’ll
find many Architects among project managers, system engineers, or marketing strategists.
Typical Architect careers also tend to allow and require independent thinking. Architects
love challenges and hate routine, and they’ll do whatever they can to avoid or automate
mind-numbing tasks. Architects excel as “lone wolves,” which makes them excellent
scientists and researchers. It is difficult to imagine an Architect choosing a strictly
administrative or teamwork-oriented role. Architects need enough breathing room to
exercise their creativity without being constantly questioned by other team members.
Architects value effectiveness and competence above anything else, so their ideal careers
will reward personal initiative and determination. Architects uphold high standards, and
they’ll rankle in situations where people advance because of connections or bravado
rather than merit. There is no easier way to lose an Architect’s respect than to value social
skills or relationships over professional competence.
Architects have excellent analytical and creative skills. They are unlikely to choose or enjoy
customer-facing or teamwork-based careers. Although Architects are brilliant strategists
and planners, they do best alone or in small teams. They’ll accept someone else’s authority
and leadership, provided they see that individual as competent. These traits make
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  121
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Architects excellent engineers, military strategists, programmers, system analysts, lawyers,
or freelance consultants.
Architects thrive in fields where they can combine their imagination, open-mindedness,
and strategic thinking skills. They are usually fascinated by research, pattern-seeking,
hypotheses, and possibilities. More often than not, Architects have lofty dreams and
ambitions, but they may hide them, even from their inner circle.
Regardless of their field, Architects are problem solvers at heart. Nothing fascinates them
more than finding a flaw in a system and devising an effective, innovative solution. They
can apply these same skills in order to gain professional recognition and advancement.
Architects’ quiet determination and sharp reasoning skills grant them a distinct advantage
over other personality types when it comes to thinking strategically about their careers.
Despite being versatile and highly intelligent, Architects will face many difficulties in their
careers if they choose the wrong path. People with this personality type are rare, and they
may not easily find inspiring role models or relevant advice for career planning. Jobs that
are perfectly suitable for 80% or more of the population would likely frustrate and exhaust
most Architects.
So how do you choose the right path?
Getting on the Career Ladder
Jacks-of-all-trades, geeks, walking encyclopedias—Architects will have heard these
compliments many times throughout their lives. (Of course, most other personality types
wouldn’t see “geek” as a compliment to begin with.) Like other Analysts, Architects are

unstoppable when they get a chance to combine their knowledge with their imagination.
That said, finding such an opportunity can be a challenge.
Whatever their hobbies or aspirations, Architects do best when they embrace technology
and science. Even if their chosen profession has no direct links with technology, Architects
should exploit and utilize the available technological and scientific tools in a way that not
only excites their imagination, but also increases the efficiency of the entire system.
When it comes to job hunting, Architects are unlikely to excel at networking and
socializing—the primary means of getting a job for many other personality types.
Architects can improve at this if they connect with like-minded individuals and take time
to improve their social skills. That said, many people with this personality type will do just
fine without an extensive social network.
The good news is that Analysts know how to plan, and Architects are particularly good in
this area. In order to find a job, they should think about what they want to achieve in life
and then work backwards to engineer several possible action plans. Finding out what the
first steps could be, mapping out the potential channels, crafting the introductory e-mail,
presenting the arguments—these things come naturally to Architects, who shouldn’t
hesitate to exploit such strengths. Not many people have the willpower or imagination
necessary to come up with a highly targeted approach, but one good e-mail sent to the
right person is often much better than 100 random applications.
During your job hunt, consider how you can present your skills in a way that distinguishes
you from other candidates. As an Architect, you probably have a range of hobbies and
interests, and this can work to your advantage. Think about what hobbies or skills could
be attractive in the field you’d like to enter, and then turn those ideas into real-life projects.
You could enter competitions, participate in volunteer projects, build an online presence
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  123
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
or blog, or write articles and submit them to media outlets. Having these projects on your
résumé will not only make you a more attractive and versatile candidate, but also provide
you with talking points for interviews. Common interview questions—for example,
“Describe a situation where you used your problem-solving skills”—are much easier when
you have multiple projects under your belt. Use your imagination and creativity to identify
things you can do right now to demonstrate and build your skills.
If you have an interview coming up, don’t assume that your technical knowledge and
enthusiasm will put you above everybody else. Instead, brush up on your presentation
skills and learn about common interview techniques and questions. Otherwise, you might
be caught off guard by a question like, “What is your biggest weakness?” Prepare to be
asked many template questions, especially in the early stages of your job hunt, and
consider your answers in advance. Architects tend to be strong candidates, but they
usually find it difficult to get that message across and may consequently lose out to less
qualified but better prepared candidates.
When making career decisions, listen to yourself and your intuition. Architects are good at
self-reflection, but this trait can be clouded by other factors, such as outside influences or
the prospect of financial gain. In the end, only you can know what will make you truly
happy. This does not mean that you should have unrealistic expectations at the start of
your career—entry-level jobs are rarely interesting or satisfying—but it is your
responsibility to find the right career path. Don’t choose a profession just because it pays
well or is seen as prestigious. Other personality types may be appeased by these
considerations, but as an Architect, you will always know that you are in the wrong place.
Your drive and focus will be of great help when it comes to landing your first job. Take care
not to neglect relationships in your pursuit of success, however. Architects often report
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  124
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
that they wish they’d spent less time in school preparing themselves for their career and
more time developing personal relationships. As an Architect, your perfectionistic
tendencies may cause you a great deal of stress, and building a network of friends and
allies, no matter how small, will offer comfort and support during hard times.
Professional Development
Architects often say that the best thing about their job, whatever it may be, is using
creativity to solve complex problems or systemic issues. In other words, people with this
personality type won’t want to check entry #319 in the accounting journal; instead, they’ll
ask why the system isn’t good enough to fix any errors automatically.
Architects are the ultimate masterminds. Some personality types are highly empathic,
which wins them many friends in the workplace. Others excel at living in the present
moment and thrive in rapidly changing situations. And some are bastions of stability and
care, putting authority and rules above all else—the keepers of balance books and
procedure documents. None of these types can match an Architect—or even come close—
when it’s time to devise a system, coordinate many moving parts, or manage the giant
chessboard of a business’s opportunities, threats, and goals. Architects’ visionary and
rational thinking is unmatched in these situations.
As an Architect, your mind is both your greatest gift and your greatest curse. If your work
environment is a good fit, you will quickly be noticed and appreciated; if not, you’ll be
endlessly frustrated by inefficiencies. Architects tend to have many transferable skills, so
do not be hesitant to promote them and look for greener pastures if a specific role is not
a good match for you.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  125

As you probably realized during your school years, you excel at absorbing new knowledge,
especially of a technical nature. Leverage this strength by seizing every opportunity you
get to learn and experiment with something new. For instance, many organizations offer
learning opportunities in the form of various training programs or subscriptions to
professional magazines, and the Internet offers a myriad of courses and lessons. Even if a
particular piece of information doesn’t offer any immediate benefits, it may prove useful
at some point. You never know when a supervisor or colleague will ask whether anyone
knows about a certain computer program or project management technique. Life is full of
these opportunities, and Architects have a major advantage over other personality types
when it comes to retaining knowledge, so expand your skill set whenever you can. In this
vein, don’t be afraid to explore subjects that are entirely new to you. These can open new
horizons and boost your self-confidence as well.
You might also consider pursuing a hobby that you could potentially turn into a source of
income in the future. This approach is common among Architects, especially those in
positions that are well paid but not intellectually challenging. The right hobby gives you an
opportunity to do something that truly excites and inspires you, without the constraints of
the employer–employee relationship. If you create value, you’ll find a way to become
profitable in time, and you’ll be able to tick another important box in the Architect’s
happiness checklist: the desire for independence.
Your hobby can be anything: a website about your favorite computer game, a local
neighborhood initiative, or a small consulting company. Some Architects want to change
the world, while others focus on local or personal matters. Just do what you truly enjoy
while retaining the safety net of regular employment—and who knows, maybe your idea
will be the next “big thing.” If you can divert some financial resources to your hobby, so
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  126
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
much the better. Architects tend to be excellent strategists, so you shouldn’t have any
difficulties managing this parallel “career.”
Architects face some liabilities and challenges in their professional development.
Remember how your mind is both a gift and a curse? In trying to determine which path is
best for you, chances are that you will overthink things and get bogged down. Find time to
think and reflect, but do not obsess over details. Ironically, Architects are usually at their
best when they are truly relaxed and confident in their skills, so don’t fret too much over
which path to take. As an Architect, you are probably more knowledgeable and resourceful
than the majority of the population, and even when you don’t know something, your
Intuitive trait will allow you to improvise and your Thinking trait will keep you on the
rational path. Think about who you truly are and what you want to achieve in life, and be
confident that your skills and knowledge will take you far.
In an office environment, another problem for most Architects is relationships. As in many
other areas of their lives, Architects rarely care about making friends or allies in the office.
If you neglect your professional relationships, however, you risk stifling your development
and missing opportunities—both personal and professional. Even casual office
relationships can be beneficial, so keep your mind open and consider getting to know your
colleagues better.
Yes, building connections will help you advance your career, but this process might also
reveal that you are actually a very good leader. Architects tend to have strong willpower,
which, combined with their desire for independence, makes them natural leaders. If you
are in a role that leverages your strengths, your non-Architect colleagues may feel a
combination of fear and respect toward you. In addition, your confidence in your opinions
and recommendations will make most people instinctively want to follow your lead. As a
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  127
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
result, there’s no need for you to compromise your integrity in order to influence others.
Instead, make an effort to establish connections and a level of mutual trust with your
colleagues. You already have an aura of mystery, so don’t alienate yourself by being
arrogant or condescending. This is a mistake most often made by younger Architects.
In all likelihood, you will need a great deal of intellectual stimulation and challenge from
your career in order to be satisfied. Unlike some other personality types, Architects never
actually satisfy their curiosity, and they’re always looking for new puzzles and pursuing
new angles on unsolved problems. Few career paths are wholly unsuitable for Architects,
but unfortunately many roles and employers may underutilize your primary skills. So
explore, learn, and find a way to use your strategic thinking skills wherever you find
yourself. But if a particular role is unsuitable for you, you won’t be able to shake the
gnawing feeling that you’re in the wrong place—no matter how well paid or stable the
position may be.
In terms of work style, Architects do not fare well in situations where they need to do
unfamiliar work under time pressures. Although you may be decisive and cool-headed in
critical situations, chances are that you will feel far more comfortable when given enough
time to assess the situation and make an informed decision. Unlike Explorers, Analysts in
general are more suited to be planners than frontline executors. You may have an
excellent set of leadership skills lurking beneath the surface, but being in “emergency
mode” will exhaust you quickly.
Finally, it bears repeating that social intelligence can be just as important as other skills, if
not more so. Many Architects dismiss this idea, seeing little value in things like small talk
and socializing. As an Architect, you value personal growth and development, so you may
find yourself disappointed by the shallowness and passivity of some people you meet. You
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  128

will nevertheless benefit by learning more about what drives and motivates other
members of society. Having these skills can give you a tremendous advantage—both at
work and elsewhere. Sometimes defusing a difficult stakeholder can get you much further
than building a system that is twice as efficient as the old one. Architects, especially
Turbulent ones, fall well behind Commanders and Debaters, their Extraverted Analyst
cousins, when it comes to being persuasive. While matching the forceful eloquence of
these two types borders on impossible, improving such skills can give Architects unique
opportunities to turn their ideas into successful projects.
Communication between Types
When you engage someone in conversation, you’ll want to find common ground and avoid
communication pitfalls. This section will explain conversational dynamics between
Analysts and the four role groups, including brief overviews of potential synergies and
obstacles, as well as some tips to help you navigate tricky waters. We’ll focus on how these
dynamics arise in the workplace, but the underlying principles apply in other settings as
well.
Analyst – Analyst Communication
Common Ground
Two Analysts will often find themselves “speaking the same language.” They both make
rational arguments and engage in conceptual discussions. Although they draw on facts,
their focus will be on big-picture ideas and concepts.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  129
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
As puzzle-solvers, Analysts explore systems and concepts, engaging in “what if” discussions
with each other. They share their ideas for improving any system or enterprise they come
across. Two Analysts can be a perfect match when it comes to brainstorming or bouncing
ideas off each other. A brainstorm between two Analysts will likely extend into a series of
discussions, as each person takes time to ponder the different facets of an idea.
If they share the Turbulent trait, both parties will aim for—or even insist on—perfection.
Other people might find their standards too demanding, but Turbulent Analysts will easily
agree that excellence is a worthy goal. (That said, they may not always agree on how to
define “perfect.”)
Analysts have contempt for ideological arguments, emotional appeals, and “soft”
rationalizations. They’ll quickly spot any of these tendencies in a business, venture, or
employer. If two Analysts notice flaws or inconsistencies in a company or its leadership,
they may form a casual alliance over such matters.
Conversations between two Analysts are often lofty, as small talk interests neither of them.
In fact, they may find each other’s company a relief from the tedium of water cooler chat.
They may also connect over their visionary tendencies and their interest in purposeful,
meaningful work.
Potential Problems
One of the biggest pitfalls two Analysts may face is competition. Being somewhat rare,
Analysts may not be used to having another Analyst in the room, and this can be
uncomfortable—especially if they encounter another Analyst who shares their specific
interest. In certain career settings with a high concentration of Analysts, the competition
can be intense, particularly for those drawn to leadership positions. Although Analysts
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  130
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
aren’t prone to drama in an emotional sense, they can be stubborn enough to cause
workplace turmoil nonetheless.
If two Analysts become competitive with each other, they may become entrenched in
opposing ideas or brutally criticize each other. Analysts often show scorn for others’
mistakes or display flawed logic. Analyst character Sheldon Cooper from “The Big Bang
Theory” is an often-mentioned archetype for this attitude. And just like Sheldon’s Analyst
friends on the show can be hurt by his judgments, Analysts in the workplace can wound
each other if they exchange harsh criticism.
Under smoother circumstances, two Analysts can find themselves in a quagmire of genius
if they produce too many great ideas while brainstorming together. With each new idea
requiring resources and entailing opportunity costs, the Analysts may become trapped in
their own cleverness. At some point, they may need to pull in a Sentinel or an Explorer to
lend a practical perspective. Established authors often advise new writers to “murder their
darlings,” or get rid of beautifully wrought lines and sentences that don’t advance the story.
At times, Analysts may need to kill their “darling” ideas for the practical good of a project
or business. If they sell themselves on their own concepts, Analysts can be stubborn. Two
or more together may be nearly unmovable.
Tips for Communicating
 Don’t hesitate to ask deep questions and share your observations with another
Analyst.
 Give other Analysts space to process new ideas or material on their own. Don’t insist
that they weigh in on something before they’ve had a chance to mull it over.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  131
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
 Be aware of any competitive urges, which can trigger stonewalling or unduly harsh
criticism.
 Not all Analysts will agree with you, and their assessments may not always be
perfect. Be prepared to display some patience and allow them to prove—or fail to
prove—their points in their own time and in their own way.
 Most Analysts like intellectual sparring, and what better partner than another
Analyst? Other types may be too sensitive or too set in their opinions. Regard other
Analysts as opportunities for engaging discussion and productive debate. Just be
careful not to waste too much time at work on the theoretical jousting.
 Introverted types within the Analyst group may need some encouragement to share
ideas, even with other Analysts. Encourage them to do so while not demanding it.
Analyst – Diplomat Communication
Common Ground
Analysts and Diplomats both prefer discussing the “big picture” rather than small details.
They absorb new knowledge almost subconsciously and then incorporate it into a larger
constellation of intuitive understanding. Both Analysts and Diplomats are imaginative and
creative as they connect the dots, often in deep and unexpected ways. These similarities,
along with their shared love of unconventional thinking, give Analysts and Diplomats
plenty of common ground and opportunities to combine their talents.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  132
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
How They Complement Each Other
Diplomats live in a world of values and empathy. Analysts are more comfortable with
systems and puzzles, and they value efficiency over all else. Diplomats add to Analysts’
offerings by bringing humanity to their systems. A Diplomat can typically provide “soul” to
any system that an Analyst devises or innovates.
On the other hand, an endeavor that prioritizes love, peace, and harmony can get a little
soft around the edges. Rational analysis is necessary for an organization or project to grow
and progress, and this is where Analysts contribute.
Diplomats and Analysts both enjoy crafting novel ideas into models or systems. Whereas
Diplomats create ideal designs for a perfect society (or perfect workforce), Analysts
imagine and devise a perfect system. To put it simply, Analysts show interest in things,
while Diplomats show interest in people. Despite this difference, Analysts and Diplomats
can get along well if they accept each other’s focus and share their own contributions
freely.
Potential Problems
The differences between efficient Analysts and empathetic Diplomats can create points of
contention. An Analyst may dismiss a Diplomat’s point of view as too soft, while a Diplomat
may regard an Analyst’s point of view as ruthless or unprincipled.
Suppose a Diplomat and an Analyst are debating next steps at a wildlife organization. As a
solution to wildebeest overpopulation, an Analyst might consider thinning the population
through hunting. After all, the Analyst might reason, overpopulation of any one species
wreaks havoc in an ecosystem. A Diplomat, on the other hand, may value all life as sacred
and propose trapping and relocation efforts to redistribute the population without
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  133
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
harming the wildebeest themselves. The conflict between efficiency and empathy is
obvious, but is either perspective wrong? While you have limited resources to preserve
balance in a wildlife community, you don’t necessarily want to be inhumane about it.
Analysts and Diplomats working together can spend a significant amount of time debating
their different approaches. An Analyst manager might argue that it would be more efficient
to replace the receptionist at the front desk with a touch-screen computer. Computers are
cheaper than a continuing salaried employee and can do essentially the same job. A
Diplomat manager in the same office will wonder about the welfare of the current
receptionist and the lack of human warmth involved in greeting a visitor with a machine.
The Analyst would highlight the time and money saved, while the Diplomat would bemoan
the sterile approach and the disregard for the employee. It may take some negotiating to
resolve such a fundamental difference, but it’s hard to say that either perspective is invalid.
When dealing with people who don’t see things their way, Analysts can be brusque and
impatient, and Diplomats can become frustrated and disappointed. Diplomats avoid
conflict, and they may disengage if their Analyst detractors come across as too harsh or
condescending. That said, Diplomats might dig in their heels if they see the Analyst’s
attitude as an “injustice.” As long as both parties are aware of these sensitivities, they can
work to maintain harmony in the workplace.
Tips for Communicating
Advice for Analysts concerning Diplomats:
 If you want a heartfelt response, ask Diplomats questions that combine both “who”
and “why” inquiries. This will allow them to draw upon their empathic and perceptive
nature.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  134
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
 To understand a Diplomat’s motivation, try to discover what values are important to
him or her.
 Diplomats can be acutely sensitive to harsh words. In the face of criticism, they may
shut down, at least temporarily.
 Express appreciation and gratitude to Diplomat colleagues, at least occasionally.
They respond well to positive regard.
Advice for Diplomats concerning Analysts:
 To get an honest response from Analysts, ask questions that begin with “why.” They
will likely enjoy discussing reasons and consequences, regardless of the topic. Be
willing to explore their view of your organization and what they think it will take to
make it run well.
 If you have trouble communicating with Analysts, don’t be afraid to ask why they
think that’s the case. Chances are they won’t be offended, and they may thoughtfully
analyze the dynamic between the two of you. Their reply may give you clues as to
how to approach them in the future.
 As intelligent as Analysts often are, they are notorious for lacking emotional
intelligence. Try not to take any unfriendly responses or comments from them too
seriously or too personally.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  135

Analyst – Sentinel Communication
Common Ground
Although they can complement each other, Sentinels and Analysts have few things in
common, except perhaps their love of efficiency. Generally speaking, Analysts focus on
large-scale systems and concepts, whereas Sentinels devote themselves to smaller, more
practical matters.
How They Complement Each Other
When they have a job that suits them, Analysts and Sentinels gravitate toward different
functions. Analysts are visionaries who assemble the building blocks of a system. Sentinels,
on the other hand, efficiently attend to business in the here and now, performing practical
tasks and creating order. Analysts often ask “what if” and “why,” while Sentinels are more
likely to ask “how”—and expect a tangible answer.
So how can these two types work with each other and communicate successfully? In some
ways, it’s a perfect match. Analysts often need someone to carry out their vision. They are
masters at manipulating ideas, but they’ll do best if they partner with someone who
converts their ideas into something practical. Sentinels can easily fulfill this role. A
stereotype of this might be the visionary CEO with the practical administrative assistant.
Think Tony Stark and Pepper Potts as caricatures of this in the Iron Man movies. While Tony
busies himself designing his technologies, Pepper keeps Stark Industries running.
Given this example, you might picture the Sentinel as subordinate to the visionary Analyst,
but this isn’t necessarily the case. An Analyst could be in a research position with a Sentinel
boss, for example, and they’d complement each other just the same.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  136
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
If they accept each other’s roles and draw on their respective strengths, each type can
become invaluable to the other. Analysts and Sentinels can create a mutually useful and
enviably productive partnership in the workplace.
Potential Problems
There’s an old saying: “Nobody likes change except a wet baby.” But this isn’t entirely true:
Intuitive types like Analysts and Diplomats love change, and they seek out new ideas and
areas for improvement. On some level, these types crave change, as it represents growth
and possibilities to them.
On the other hand, Sentinels adhere to proven standards and traditions, and they like to
work with the status quo. Analysts have little regard for the status quo, especially if it gets
in the way of improving a system. Sentinels may insist on doing something the “right” way,
according to how it’s always been done. Meanwhile, Analysts may insist on doing it a
“better” way, regardless of how it’s always been done.
The conflict between tradition and change is perhaps as old as humanity itself, and it can
certainly create problems in the workplace. Between an Analyst and a Sentinel, this tension
can play out in the form of passive-aggressive resistance or discounting each other’s
contributions. Avoiding this situation entails careful communication, reassurance, and
much understanding.
In terms of their social style, Analysts can lack warmth and consideration for the emotional
needs of others. Sentinels are nurturers and preservers who can be compassionate and
empathetic with their co-workers. Although Sentinels can be rigidly efficient or even
controlling, they prioritize the welfare of others and can be extremely loyal.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  137
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
Sentinels would do well not to take an Analyst’s criticism too personally—whether it’s
directed at themselves or at others. Analysts would do well to understand that Sentinels
may react badly to harsh comments and off-the-cuff negative feedback. Since Sentinels
are so invested in the status quo and making things run well, they sometimes take criticism
towards an organization or others very personally.
Tips for Communicating
Advice for Analysts concerning Sentinels:
 Make an effort to show appreciation for Sentinels’ contributions. They don’t
necessarily seek gratitude from others, but they become energized when they get
it.
 Be thoughtful and measured when you suggest changes to a system. Understand
that Sentinels’ first impulse will be to preserve the status quo. Changes can shake
their sense of control.
 Avoid unproductive criticism of others when speaking with Sentinels.
 To connect with a Sentinel, link your theories and ideas to practical, specific tasks.
Advice for Sentinels concerning Analysts:
 Remember that Analyst coworkers benefit from your attention to detail—even if
they don’t seem to recognize or appreciate it.
 Try not to take any criticism or harsh comments from an Analyst personally.
 Don’t burden Analysts with unnecessary details. They may not even respond to such
information.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  138

Analyst – Explorer Communication
Common Ground
Both Explorers and Analysts enjoy searching for answers, but their methods of doing so
are very different. While Analysts enjoy theorizing about ideas and systems, Explorers
would rather solve problems in a hands-on fashion. Analysts prefer to think through
potential outcomes and consequences before acting, whereas Explorers can’t wait to get
started.
If Analysts and Explorers tolerate their differences and recognize that their goals are
aligned, however, they can engage in productive discussions. In business as in any
relationship, collaboration is only possible if two people bond over their common purpose
while recognizing the value of their differences.
How They Complement One Another
Explorers and Analysts can create a powerful working relationship, provided they
recognize their different strengths. These types can work together as a two-step process,
with Analysts generating new ideas and Explorers figuring out how to make them a reality.
Analysts are notoriously weak at implementation, whereas Explorers are strong. On the
other hand, Explorers sometimes focus on details at the expense of the big picture—a
tendency that can put them out of sync with an organization’s vision. In this situation,
Analysts can help Explorers realign with the larger principles and motivations behind a
project.
Consider the story of Apollo 13, a NASA space mission in 1970. After a mechanical mishap,
it wasn’t clear whether the three U.S. astronauts on board the spacecraft could make it
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  139
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
back to Earth alive. In this situation, ground control in Houston can be thought of as the
Analysts. These team members calculated all the numbers and worked out a trajectory
that could get the astronauts home. The astronauts on board served as Explorers, doing
the hands-on work and executing the details, and they eventually got the capsule home.
Communication between ground control and the astronauts was vital to the success of the
rescue. This illustrates how Explorers’ and Analysts’ different functions and styles can work
together to fulfill the same goal.
Potential Problems
An Analyst may become annoyed by Explorers’ focus on details, while an Explorer may feel
that Analysts’ ideas are too vague and impractical. It can be tempting for Explorers to
dismiss Analysts as having their heads in the clouds, not understanding the practical side
of anything, or being too slow to act. On the other hand, Analysts can be condescending
toward people who don’t inhabit their world of lofty notions, strategic planning, and
complex systems. They may dismiss Explorers as uninspired, narrow-minded, or reckless.
If these frustrations get out of hand, communication between the two parties will shut
down.
Tips for Communicating
Advice for Analysts concerning Explorers:
 Explorers become bored with conceptual matters. Don’t spend too much time
discussing theory when speaking with them. Instead, share a quick overview of your
ideas, add the facts you know, and give Explorers the space they need to create a
workable implementation. They might surprise you by bringing your ideas to life in
exciting ways.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  140
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
 Genius comes in many forms. Remember that Explorers often have a different kind
of intelligence, one that relies on details and execution. While Explorers’ focus on
details may seem tedious to you, success can hinge on their attention to the finer
points. Be patient with Explorers and don’t try to force them to work in ways that
are foreign to them. Respect their style, just as you expect them to respect yours.
 To draw out Explorers, approach them with “how” questions. Let them showcase
their problem-solving abilities.
Advice for Explorers concerning Analysts:
 Analysts become bored by details, and unlike you, they won’t care to know about
every last fact. When you talk with them, explain how your ideas will affect the larger
organization or system, and ask them to give you feedback from that perspective.
An Analyst’s vantage point can save you from unwittingly going in the wrong
direction. The “long-range view” is often your blind spot, and Analysts can help you
with that.
 Don’t dismiss Analysts as too theoretical or impractical. Like you, they’re working
toward an efficient outcome. Try to find common ground here, even if doing so
seems fruitless. You might be surprised how helpful allying with an Analyst can be
in the long run.
 To draw out Analysts, approach them with “why” questions.

Career Progression
So you’ve found a job and settled in. You’ve even learned how best to communicate with
colleagues from different role groups. But what now? As an Architect, how can you
progress in your career, and what difficulties will you likely face?
As they advance in their careers, Architects tend to do best in non-managerial roles. People
with this personality type will naturally excel as subject matter experts rather than as
senior managers with dozens of subordinates. Many companies—especially large
corporations and science/tech companies—have developed alternate career tracks that
reward and promote employees without giving them managerial roles. In the right
organization, Architect employees can secure promotions without being burdened by
supervisory tasks.
Even in fields where promotions entail management responsibilities, however, Architects
can find their way. Like all Analysts, Architects are good at mapping out processes and
systems, and they’ll inevitably come up with ideas and suggestions that improve the
efficiency of the business model. Furthermore, their natural curiosity (some might call it
nosiness) will lead Architects to learn about a variety of projects and business areas, which
enables them to indirectly influence activities not related to their specific role.
By generating new ideas and learning about various facets of their companies, Architects
can gain recognition, attract promotions, and widen the scope of their influence—all
without overburdening themselves or accruing managerial responsibilities. Their job
security and future prospects will improve as well. In such situations, however, it can be a
challenge to receive appropriate financial compensation. Many employers are reluctant to
give an employee a raise without conferring additional managerial responsibilities as well.
“The Architect” (INTJ)
Career and Professional Development  142
©2011-2016 NERIS Analytics Limited. All rights reserved.
It is also important to remember that, in some organizations, senior positions don’t grant
employees more freedom or latitude. If anything, these roles can entail more red tape and
closer supervision. Architects excel in positions where they can work independently to
devise and implement solutions. In some organizations, climbing higher on the corporate
ladder can limit rather than expand these opportunities. In these cases, an Architect might
do well to stay in the same role, use the time to learn and grow, and then find a better-
paid job at a different company. Traditional promotion paths and corporate jockeying are
not made for Architects.
Alternative Options
Sometimes, Architects won’t be able to advance at their current workplace—either
because their employers don’t value Architect traits or because there simply isn’t room for
growth. Aside from changing employers, there are alternative options—some of them
unexpected—for Architects who find themselves in this situation.
This may seem radical, but you don’t need to be employed to live comfortably. We live in
an age of possibilities, and selling your time to a corporation is not the only way to generate
income. Architects are imaginative, bold individuals, and thanks to their ability to generate
new ideas and make surprising connections, they can thrive as entrepreneurs.
Many people find the notion of self-employment quite scary, but these days, even
traditionally employed people rarely have true job security or guarantees of advancement.
Consequently, working for yourself can be a viable option, and it offers many benefits that
align with Architect values, including flexibility, independence, and control over projects.
Furthermore, self-employment eliminates a major hurdle for Architects in a corporate
environment: forced interaction with other people. Self-employed people can choose

which tasks they want to perform and which they want to delegate or outsource. This
means that entrepreneurial Architects can sidestep some of their pet peeves, including
following orders, doing tedious administrative work, or dealing with people who are
unable or unwilling to improve. Self-employment offers many major benefits to Architects,
especially in today’s global and always-connected environment, and people with this
personality type can be highly successful in this area.
Of course, there is no point in trying to start a business without a good idea. This is where
Architects’ ability to come up with unusual connections enables them to shine. Anyone can
think up a product, but it takes an imaginative mind to come up with an idea, product, or
solution that could grow into an innovative business venture. After all, there’s a reason
why Google and Facebook were developed by geeks in their basements and dorm rooms
rather than engineers working 9 – 5 at multinational companies. If you decide to try your
hand at entrepreneurship, use your creativity and strategic thinking skills to devise an
interesting way to fulfill an existing need (or create one), and don’t be afraid to experiment.
Architects can be excellent entrepreneurs, having both the imagination necessary to
develop a good business model and the willpower to keep going in difficult times.
Suitable Careers
Let’s look at some specific jobs that tend to fit Architects the best. It’s not possible or
feasible for us to offer a full list of professions, but we’ll outline a sampling of jobs that are
consistent with Architects’ personality traits, with added explanations of why they fit. You
can use these descriptions to create guidelines when thinking about your own career
goals.

For those of you already employed, this may serve as a confirmation or an explanation for
why you’re happy or unhappy in your current role. We can’t tell you how to be successful
or happy, but we hope the following material will offer you some insight as you make your
personal decisions.
A career in business strategy will be quite different from one in intelligent engineering, so
we’ve separated these career opportunities into different fields or areas of interest that
tend to be appropriate for Architects.
Engineering and Design
Engineering and design are broad categories for disciplines that use science, math, design
techniques, and ingenuity to create a machine, structure, or system. People in this field
create new products, improve old ones, and find new applications for their technology or
expertise.
Architects have a knack for spotting trends and tendencies in the noise of irrelevant details
– and then using that information to improve an existing system or build a better one. This
curiosity and desire for efficiency makes them excellent candidates for Engineering and
Design roles. Furthermore, most engineers and designers labor alone over a drafting table,
a computer, or a workbench much of the time, and this satisfies Architects’ “lone wolf”
nature. Some positions that might appeal to them include:
 Software Engineer
 Mechanical, Electrical, or any other type of Engineer
 Architect
 Inventor
 Environmental Planner
 Urban Planner

These roles can be extremely challenging, but conquering such challenges is immensely
rewarding for Architects.
Research / Science
Architects have a deep need to discover how everything works. They love discovery, and
they’re also fascinated by the patterns that reveal themselves through research. Architects
take the initiative to explore uncharted territory or to find a different approach to old
disciplines. Some of the jobs in this category include:
 Academic Researcher / Professor
 Physical Scientist
 Life Scientist
 Astronomer
 Medical Researcher
 Physicist
 Psychological Researcher
 Chemist
Architect researchers and scientists admire others with similar drive and abilities, and they
can collaborate successfully if they feel they are dealing with equals. Otherwise, they may
be better off working on their own. Fortunately, a science or research position does not
necessarily require much social connection.
Medicine
In the medical field, Architects make thorough diagnosticians and practitioners. What they
may lack in bedside manner, they make up for in competency. Their Intuitive trait allows
Architect physicians to quickly assess a constellation of symptoms and discern an accurate

diagnosis. They use a similar big-picture approach to develop effective treatment
recommendations. Any of the following fields would be satisfying to Architects who find
themselves fascinated by medical puzzles:
 Psychiatrist
 Pathologist
 Neurologist
 Pharmacologist
 Cardiologist
 Diagnostician
Clinical roles may require more social interaction than research positions, but they give
Architects the opportunity to brainstorm new ideas and pool their mental resources with
people who share their dedication and intellect.
Strategy
It’s no accident that Architects are part of a role group called Analysts. Architects can easily
envision and manipulate systems, mentally dissecting them, identifying areas for
improvement, and then rebuilding them in a more useful way. Calling this section
“Strategy” is cheating a little bit. Everything Architects do will be strategic in some fashion,
but not all strategic jobs neatly fit into categories. So this section serves as a catch-all.
 Business Administrator
 Management Consultant
 Project Manager
 Military Officer
 Educational Consultant
 Investment Analyst

What do these jobs have in common? They all concern far-reaching problems and offer
opportunities to devise and implement new strategies—in other words, what Architects
do best.
What Makes Jobs Unsuitable for Architects?
In modern society, we spend a great deal of time at work, and we also look to our careers
to give our lives meaning. As a result, it’s important that we avoid job situations that don’t
harmonize with our personality. Here are some characteristics of jobs that may not be
suitable for Architects:
Restrictive Environment
Architects like to experiment and to explore new ideas. If the structures and rules of a
workplace are too rigid, Architects will feel stifled and unfulfilled. Passionate puzzle-
solvers, Architects won’t function at their highest capacity when restrictive job
environments prevent them from pursuing new avenues and ideas.
To function at their fullest, Architects need independence, not supervision. Strict
guidelines, rigid standards, or micromanagement will only get in their way. People with
this personality type need mental room to play and pursue their passions. They may also
chafe at office politics and resent feeling as if they’re locked into a pre-set career path.
Some examples of careers Architects may find unsuitable for these reasons include:
 Administrative Assistant
 Soldier
 Accountant
 Regulations Enforcer

Career and Professional Development  148

 Judge
Work That Is Too Dependent on Face Time
Architects tend to work best alone. Like any Introverted type, Architects will become
exhausted if they’re forced to work with others for too long. Beyond this, Architects can
resent other people as obstacles and distractions, and they may be sarcastic or
condescending to those they consider less than their equals. This attitude can create an
unpleasant work environment and damage morale.
Some examples of likely unsuitable careers in this category include:
 Fashion Designer
 Tour Guide
 Retail Sales Clerk
 Politician
 Street Performer
Workplace Habits
Most of us will spend a huge percentage of our lives at work, so understanding how a
personality type manifests itself in the workplace is important.
Here is a breakdown of how Architects function in different workplace relationships.
Colleagues
 Fiercely independent at work, people with the Architect personality type are “lone
wolves”
 Love challenges, especially if they get complete responsibility

 Prefer working alone, mostly because they believe that others would slow them
down
 Enjoy brainstorming, as long as the discussion does not descend into arguments
over details
 Have perfectionist tendencies and rarely give up
 Cannot stand inefficiency; resent colleagues who refuse to use more efficient
methods
 Loathe repetitive work, especially when it can be automated
 See little point in networking, socializing, or small talk
 Intensely private and likely to deflect personal questions
 Very sarcastic; might make subtle jokes at the expense of colleagues whom they
consider less insightful
 Prefer e-mails to phone calls
 Brilliant masterminds and analysts
 Able to recognize various undercurrents and tension between certain colleagues in
the workplace and avoid them. (Architects are unlikely to use this knowledge to their
advantage, though.)
 Judgmental; have little respect for colleagues they believe are incompetent
Managers
 Have very high standards when it comes to professional competence
 Willing to give their subordinates a lot of freedom at work
 Casual and relaxed, valuing independent thinking more than protocol
 Despise schmoozing or attempts to manipulate
 Likely to treat subordinates as equals
 Respect others’ opinions, as long as the arguments are valid and non-emotional

 More interested in strategy than implementation
 Strive for efficiency, often at the expense of tradition
 Highly respect and reward initiative
 Do not mind being proven wrong if someone else’s argument is better
 Will not get involved in office gossip or socializing
Subordinates
 Only respect managers whom they find competent. (Titles mean nothing to
someone with an Architect personality.)
 Will openly disagree with their manager, as long as they think their opinion will be
taken into account. (Beware a quiet Architect during a brainstorming session.
Chances are that they don’t respect the other participants enough to bother airing
their opinions.)
 Accept and actually enjoy criticism at work, as long as it is supported by valid
arguments
 Rarely seek managerial positions; would rather be well-paid experts. (People with
this personality type are unlikely to be a threat to their managers from this
perspective.)
 May become frustrated when not given enough freedom at work
 Will strongly resist attempts to pigeon-hole them into specific, well-defined roles

Some Final Words
We’ve covered many different topics in this profile. Our hope is that you better understand
not only yourself, but also other people and their perspectives. It is often tempting to try
to change others, especially if we believe our reasons are good and noble, but such
attempts usually fail. By simply understanding each other better, we can be more aware,
genuine, and peaceful as we each make our way through the world.
This profile is not meant to be read once. Don’t file it away and never open it again.
Whenever you wish you understood someone better, or struggle to understand yourself,
take another look. Maybe you’ll find a relevant insight or piece of information.
Furthermore, spend some time at 16personalities.com—especially in the articles section,
research area, or members’ zone. There is a wealth of inspiring advice and information on
the site, and we strongly recommend that you take a look. If you have some spare time,
consider lending us a helping hand by contributing to the translation project, taking

this profile or the website in general. We would love to hear from you.
Personality types are useful tools for personal growth and mutual understanding, but
remember that people are too complex to be completely defined by their types. Please try
to avoid using types as lazy labels. Make sure you stop yourself when you catch yourself
thinking something like, “What else can you expect from [type],” or “She is a [type] so I must
do this.” These reductive analyses can do more harm than good. Types can be amazingly
helpful, but no type will fully describe who someone is. Use the type as a lens, not as a box
to put people in.

Best of luck on your path, Architect. It may not be easy, but few things worth doing are.
Ultimately, what matters most is that your path reflects who you really are, deep within.
Our lives are often too full of troubles, conflicts, and worries that lie beyond our control or
matter little in the grand scheme of things. But if you remember to take a break from time
to time and think about your values, dreams, and ideals, the right path will become just a
little clearer of superficial distractions. We modestly hope that we have lighted a few
lanterns along the way too.
Until next time.
